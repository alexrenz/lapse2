uses see liberal disambiguation liberalism is an ideology broad political tradition and current of political thought which holds liberty as the primary political value broadly speaking liberalism seeks a society characterized by freedom of thought for individuals limitations on the power of government and religion and sometimes corporations the rule of law the free exchange of ideas a market economy that supports private enterprise and a system of government that is transparent this form of government favors liberal democracy with open and fair elections where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government such as the divine right of kings hereditary status and established religion fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life liberty and property in many countries modern liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well being takes priority over freedom from taxation liberalism has it roots in the western enlightenment but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum from left to right in academia in the context of economics the term liberalism refers to economic liberalism the nature and origins of liberalism etymology and historical usage the word liberal derives from the latin liber free from which the term liberty also comes livy s history of rome from its foundation describes the struggles for freedom between the plebeian and patrician classes largely dormant during the vicissitudes of the middle ages this struggle began again in the italian renaissance in the conflict between the supporters of free city states and the supporters of the pope niccol machiavelli in his discourses on livy laid down the principles of republican government john locke in england and the thinkers of the french enlightenment articulated the struggle for freedom in terms of the rights of man the oxford english dictionary oed indicates that the word liberal has long been in the english language with the meanings of befitting free men noble generous as in liberal arts also with the meaning free from restraint in speech or action as in liberal with the purse or liberal tongue usually as a term of reproach but beginning one seven seven six eight eight imbued with a more favorable sense by edward gibbon and others to mean free from prejudice tolerant the first english language use to mean tending in favor of freedom and democracy according to the oed dates from about one eight zero one and comes from the french lib ral originally applied in english by its opponents often in fr form and with suggestions of foreign lawlessness an early english language citation the extinction of every vestige of freedom and of every liberal idea with which they are associated the american war of independence established the first nation to craft a constitution based on the concept of liberal government especially the idea that governments rule by the consent of the governed the more moderate bourgeois elements of the french revolution tried to establish a government based on liberal principles economists such as adam smith in the wealth of nations one seven seven six enunciated the liberal principles of free trade the editors of the spanish constitution of one eight one two drafted in c diz may have been the first to use the word liberal in a political sense as a noun they named themselves the liberales to express their opposition to the absolutist power of the spanish monarchy beginning in the late one eight th century liberalism became a major ideology in virtually all developed countries trends within liberalism within the above framework there are deep often bitter conflicts and controversies among liberals emerging from those controversies out of classical liberalism are a number of different trends within liberalism as in many debates opposite sides use different words for the same beliefs and sometimes use identical words for different beliefs for the purposes of this article we will use political liberalism for the support of liberal democracy either in a republic or a constitutional monarchy over absolute monarchy or dictatorship cultural liberalism for the support of individual liberty over laws limiting liberty for patriotic or religious reasons economic liberalism for the support of private property over government regulation and social liberalism for the support of equality over inequalities of opportunity by modern liberalism we mean the mixture of these forms of liberalism found in most first world countries today rather than any one of the pure forms listed above one trend within liberalism has been a consensus towards the following political liberalism is the belief that individuals are the basis of law and society and that society and its institutions exist to further the ends of individuals without showing favor to those of higher social rank the magna carta is an example of a political document that asserted the rights of individuals even above the prerogatives of monarchs political liberalism stresses the social contract under which citizens make the laws and agree to abide by those laws it is based on the belief that individuals know best what is best for them political liberalism includes the extension of the right to vote to women non whites and those who do not own property political liberalism emphasizes the rule of law and supports liberal democracy cultural liberalism focuses on the rights of individuals pertaining to conscience and lifestyle including such issues as sexual freedom religious freedom cognitive freedom and protection from government intrusion into private life john stuart mill aptly expressed cultural liberalism in his essay on liberty when he wrote the sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self protection that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others his own good either physical or moral is not a sufficient warrant cultural liberalism generally opposes government regulation of literature art academics gambling sex prostitution the age of consent abortion birth control terminal illness alcohol and marijuana and other controlled substances most liberals oppose some or all government intervention in these areas the netherlands in this respect may be the most liberal country in the world today however some trends within liberalism reveal stark differences of opinion economic liberalism many of whose adherents term it classical liberalism is an ideology which supports the individual rights of property and freedom of contract the watchword of this form of liberalism is free enterprise it advocates laissez faire capitalism meaning the removal of legal barriers to trade and cessation of government bestowed privilege such as subsidy and monopoly economic liberals want little or no government regulation of the market some economic liberals would accept government restrictions of monopolies and cartels others argue that monopolies and cartels are caused by state action economic liberalism holds that the value of goods and services should be set by the unfettered choices of individuals that is of market forces some would also allow market forces to act even in areas conventionally monopolized by governments such as the provision of security and courts economic liberalism accepts the economic inequality that arises from unequal bargaining positions as being the natural result of competition so long as no coercion is used this form of liberalism is especially influenced by english liberalism of the mid one nine th century minarchism and anarcho capitalism are forms of economic liberalism see also free trade neo liberalism liberalization social liberalism also known as new liberalism not to be confused with neoliberalism reform liberalism or welfare liberalism arose in the late one nine th century in many developed countries influenced by the utilitarianism of jeremy bentham and john stuart mill some liberals accepted in part or in whole marxist and socialist exploitation theory and critiques of the profit motive and concluded that government should use its power to remedy these perceived problems according to the tenets of this form of liberalism as explained by writers such as john dewey and mortimer adler since individuals are the basis of society all individuals should have access to basic necessities of fulfillment such as education economic opportunity and protection from harmful macro events beyond their control to social liberals these benefits are considered rights these positive rights which must be produced and supplied by other people are qualitatively different from the classic negative rights which require only that others refrain from aggression to the social liberal ensuring positive rights is a goal that is continuous with the general project of protecting liberties schools libraries museums and art galleries are to be supported by taxes social liberalism advocates some restrictions on economic competition such as anti trust laws and price controls on wages minimum wage laws it also expects governments to provide a basic level of welfare supported by taxation intended to enable the best use of the talents of the population to prevent revolution or simply for the public good there is a fundamental antagonism between economic and social liberalism economic liberals see positive rights as necessarily violating negative rights and therefore illegitimate they see a limited role for government some economic liberals see no proper function of government while others would limit government to courts police and defense against foreign invasion minarchists social liberals in contrast see a major role for government in promoting the general welfare providing some or all of the following services food and shelter for those who cannot provide for themselves medical care schools retirement care for children and for the disabled including those disabled by old age help for victims of natural disaster protection of minorities prevention of crime and support for the arts and sciences this largely abandons the idea of limited government both forms of liberalism seek the same end liberty but they disagree strongly about the best or most moral means to attain it some liberal parties emphasize economic liberalism while others focus on social liberalism conservative parties often favor economic liberalism while opposing social and cultural liberalism in all of the forms of liberalism listed above there is a general belief that there should be a balance between government and private responsibilities and that government should be limited to those tasks which cannot be carried out best by the private sector all forms of liberalism claim to protect the fundamental dignity and autonomy of the individual under law all claim that freedom of individual action promotes the best society liberalism is so widespread in the modern world that most western nations at least pay lip service to individual liberty as the basis for society comparative influences early enlightenment thinkers contrasted liberalism with the authoritarianism of the ancien regime feudalism mercantilism and the roman catholic church later as more radical philosophers articulated their thoughts in the course of the french revolution and throughout the nineteenth century liberalism defined itself in contrast to socialism and communism although modern european liberal parties have often formed coalitions with social democratic parties in the two zero th century liberalism defined itself in opposition to totalitarianism and collectivism some modern liberals have rejected the classical just war theory which emphasizes neutrality and free trade in favor of multilateral interventionism and collective security liberalism favors limited state power extreme anti statist liberalism as advocated by gustave de molinari herbert spencer and auberon herbert is sometimes considered a form of anarchism or libertarianism most liberals claim that a government is necessary to protect rights recently liberalism has again come into conflict with those who seek a society ordered by religious values radical islamism often rejects liberal thought in its entirety development of liberal thought origins of liberal thought john locke the focus on liberty as an essential right of people within the polity has been repeatedly asserted throughout history mentioned above are the conflicts between the plebeians and patricians in ancient rome and the struggles of italian city states against the papal states the republics of florence and venice had forms of elections the rule of law and pursuit of free enterprise through much of the one four zero zero s until domination by outside powers in the one six th century the dutch resistance against spanish catholic oppression is often despite its refusal to give freedom to catholics considered a predecessor of liberal values as an ideology liberalism can trace its roots back to the humanism that began to challenge the authority of the established church during the renaissance and the whigs of the glorious revolution in great britain whose assertion of their right to choose their king can be seen as a precursor to claims of popular sovereignty however movements generally labelled as truly liberal date from the enlightenment particularly the whig party in britain the philosophes in france and the movement towards self government in colonial america these movements opposed absolute monarchy mercantilism and various kinds of religious orthodoxy and clericalism they were also the first to formulate the concepts of individual rights under the rule of law as well as the importance of self government through elected representatives the definitive break with the past was the conception that free individuals could form the foundation for a stable society this idea is generally dated from the work of john locke one six three two one seven zero four whose two treatises on government established two fundamental liberal ideas economic liberty meaning the right to have and use property and intellectual liberty including freedom of conscience which he expounded in a letter concerning toleration one six eight nine however he did not extend his views on religious freedom to catholics locke developed further the earlier idea of natural rights which he saw as life liberty and property his natural rights theory was the distant forerunner of the modern conception of human rights however to locke property was more important than the right to participate in government and public decision making he did not endorse democracy because he feared that giving power to the people would erode the sanctity of private property nevertheless the idea of natural rights played a key role in providing the ideological justification for the american revolution and the french revolution montesquieu on the european continent the doctrine of laws restraining even monarchs was expounded by charles de secondat baron de montesquieu whose the spirit of the laws argues that better is it to say that the government most conformable to nature is that which best agrees with the humour and disposition of the people in whose favour it is established rather than accept as natural the mere rule of force following in his footsteps political economist jean baptiste say and destutt de tracy were ardent exponents of the harmonies of the market and in all probability it was they who coined the term laissez faire this evolved into the physiocrats and to the political economy of rousseau the late french enlightenment saw two figures who would have tremendous influence on later liberal thought voltaire who argued that the french should adopt constitutional monarchy and disestablish the second estate and rousseau who argued for a natural freedom for mankind both argued in different forms for changes in political and social arrangements based around the idea that society can restrain a natural human liberty but not obliterate its nature for voltaire the concept was more intellectual for rousseau it was related to intrinsic natural rights perhaps related to the ideas of diderot anders chydenius rousseau also argued the importance of a concept that appears repeatedly in the history of liberal thought namely the social contract he rooted this in the nature of the individual and asserted that each person knows their own interest best his assertion that man is born free but that education was sufficient to restrain him within society rocked the monarchical society of his age his assertion of an organic will of a nation argued for self determination of peoples again in contravention of established political practice his ideas were a key element in the declaration of the national assembly in the french revolution and in the thinking of americans such as benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson in his view the unity of a state came from the concerted action of consent or the national will this unity of action would allow states to exist without being chained to pre existing social orders such as aristocracy a main contributing group of thinkers whose work would become considered part of liberalism are those associated with the scottish enlightenment including the writers david hume adam smith and immanuel kant adam smith david hume s contributions were many and varied but most important was his assertion that fundamental rules of human behavior would overwhelm attempts to restrict or regulate them in a treatise of human nature one seven three nine one seven four zero one example of this is in his disparaging of mercantilism and the accumulation of gold and silver he argued that prices were related to the quantity of money and that hoarding gold and issuing paper money would only lead to inflation although adam smith is the most famous of the economic liberal thinkers he was not without antecedents the physiocrats in france had proposed studying systematically political economy and the self organizing nature of markets benjamin franklin wrote in favor of the freedom of american industry in one seven five zero in sweden finland the period of liberty and parliamentary government from one seven one eight to one seven seven two produced a finnish parliamentarian anders chydenius who was one of the first to propose free trade and unregulated industry in the national gain one seven six five his impact has proven to be lasting particularly in the nordic area but it also had a powerful effect in the later development elsewhere the scotsman adam smith one seven two three one seven nine zero expounded the theory that individuals could structure both moral and economic life without direction from the state and that nations would be strongest when their citizens were free to follow their own initiative he advocated an end to feudal and mercantile regulations to state granted monopolies and patents and he promulgated laissez faire government in the theory of moral sentiments one seven five nine he developed a theory of motivation that tried to reconcile human self interest and an unregulated social order in the wealth of nations one seven seven six he argued that the market under certain conditions would naturally regulate itself and would produce more than the heavily restricted markets that were the norm at the time he assigned to government the role of taking on tasks which could not be entrusted to the profit motive such as preventing individuals from using force or fraud to disrupt competition trade or production his theory of taxation was that governments should levy taxes only in ways which did not harm the economy and that the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state he agreed with hume that capital not gold is the wealth of a nations immanuel kant immanuel kant was strongly influenced by hume s empiricism and rationalism his most important contributions to liberal thinking are in the realm of ethics particularly his assertion of the categorical imperative kant argued that received systems of reason and morals were subordinate to natural law and that therefore attempts to stifle this basic law would meet with failure his idealism would become increasingly influential since it asserted that there were fundamental truths upon which systems of knowledge could be based this meshed with the ideas of the english enlightenment about natural rights revolutionary liberalism these thinkers however worked within the political framework of monarchies and in societies in which the class system and an established church were the norm the idea that ordinary human beings could structure their own affairs remained theoretical until the american and french revolutions the glorious revolution of one six eight eight is often cited as a precedent but it replaced one monarch with another monarch it was however necessary for the suppression of the jacobite uprisings which weakened the power of the monarch and strengthened the british parliament these two late one eight th century revolutions became the examples which later revolutionary liberals followed both used as their philosophical justification the rights of man or the rights given in the words of henry st john by nature and nature s god they rejected both tradition and established power thomas paine thomas paine thomas jefferson and john adams would be instrumental in persuading their fellow americans to revolt in the name of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness echoing locke but with one important change opposed by alexander hamilton jefferson replaced locke s word property by the pursuit of happiness the american experiment would be in favor of democratic government and individual liberty james madison was prominent among the next generation of political theorists in america arguing that in a republic self government depended on setting interest against interest thus providing protection for the rights of minorities particularly economic minorites the american constitution instituted a system of checks and balances federal government balanced against states rights executive legislative and judicial branches and a bicameral legislature the goal was to insure liberty by preventing the concentration of power in the hands of any one man standing armies were held in suspicion and the belief was that the militia would be enough for defense along with a navy maintained by the government for the purpose of trade declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen the french revolution overthrew monarch aristocratic social order and an established roman catholic church these revolutionaries were more vehement and less compromising than those in america a key moment in the french revolution was the declaration by the representatives of the third estate that they were the national assembly and had the right to speak for the french people during the first few years the revolution was guided by liberal ideas but the transition from revolt to stability was to prove more difficult than the similar american transition in addition to native enlightenment traditions some leaders of the early phase of the revolution such as lafayette had fought in the u s war of independence against britain and brought home anglo american liberal ideas later under the leadership of maximilien robespierre a jacobin faction greatly centralized power and dispensed with most aspects of due process resulting in the reign of terror instead of an ultimately republican constitution napoleon bonaparte rose from director to consul to emperor on his death bed he confessed they wanted another washington meaning a man who could militarily establish a new state without desiring a dynasty nevertheless the french revolution would go farther than the american revolution in establishing liberal ideals with such policies as universal male suffrage national citizenship and a far reaching declaration of the rights of man and citizen paralleling the american bill of rights one of the side effects of napoleon s military campaigns was to carry these ideas throughout europe benito juarez the examples of united states and france were followed in many other countries the usurpation of the spanish monarchy by napoleon s forces in one eight zero eight led to autonomist and independence movements across latin america which often turned to liberal ideas as alternatives to the monarchical clerical corporatism of the colonial era movements such as that led by simon bolivar in the andean countries aspired to constitutional government individual rights and free trade the struggle between liberals and corporatist conservatives continued for the rest of the century in latin america with anti clerical liberals like benito juarez of mexico attacking the traditional role of the roman catholic church the transition to liberal society in europe sometimes came through revolutionary or secessionist violence and there were repeated explicitly liberal revolutions and revolts throughout europe in the first half of the one nine th century however in britain and many other nations the process was driven more by politics than revolution even if the process was not entirely tranquil the anti clerical violence during the french revolution was seen by opponents at the time and for most of the one nine th century as explicitly liberal in origin at the same time many french liberals were victim too of the jacobin terror with the coming of romanticism liberal notions moved from being proposals for reform of existing governments to demands for change the american revolution and the french revolution would add democracy to the list of values which liberal thought promoted the idea that the people were sovereign and capable of making all necessary laws and enforcing them went beyond the conceptions of the enlightenment instead of merely asserting the rights of individuals within the state all of the state s powers were derived from the nature of man natural law given by god supernatural law or by contract the just consent of the governed this made compromise with previously autocratic orders far less likely and the resulting violence was justified in the minds of monarchists to restore order the contractual nature of liberal thought to this point must be stressed one of the basic ideas of the first wave of thinkers in the liberal tradition was that individuals made agreements and owned property this may not seem a radical notion today but at the time most property laws defined property as belonging to a family or to a particular figure within it such as the head of the family obligations were based on feudal ties of loyalty and personal fealty rather than an exchange of goods and services gradually the liberal tradition introduced the idea that voluntary consent and voluntary agreement were the basis for legitimate government and law this view was further advanced by rousseau with his notion of a social contract between one seven seven four and one eight four eight there were several waves of revolutions each revolution demanding greater and greater primacy for individual rights the revolutions placed increasing value on self governance this could lead to secession a particularly important concept in the revolutions which ended spanish control over much of her colonial empire in the americas and in the american revolution european liberals particularly after the french constitution of one seven nine three thought that democracy considered as majority rule by propertyless men would be a danger to private property and favored a franchise limited to those with a certain amount of property later liberal democrats like de tocqueville disagreed in countries where feudal property arrangements still held sway liberals generally supported unification as the path to liberty the strongest examples of this are germany and italy as part of this revolutionary program the importance of education a value repeatedly stressed from erasmus onward became more and more central to the idea of liberty liberal parties in many european monarchies agitated for parliamentary government increased representation expansion of the franchise where present and the creation of a counterweight to monarchical power this political liberalism was often driven by economic liberalism namely the desire to end feudal privileges guild or royal monopolies restrictions on ownership and laws which did not permit the full range of corporate and economic arrangements being developed in other countries to one degree or another these forces were seen even in autocracies such as turkey russia and japan as the russian empire crumbled under the weight of economic failure and military defeat it was the liberal parties who took control of the duma and in one nine zero five and one nine one seven began revolutions against the government later piero gobetti would formulate a theory of liberal revolution to explain what he felt was the radical element in liberal ideology another example of this form of liberal revolution is from ecuador where eloy alfaro in one eight nine five lead a radical liberal revolution that secularized the state opened marriage laws engaged in the development of infrastructure and the economy disputes within liberalism economic versus social liberalism the industrial revolution greatly increased material wealth but also represented a radical cleavage with the traditional social order and brought with it new social problems such as pollution alienation overcrowding in the cities and child labour material and scientific progress led to greater longevity and a reduced mortality rate the population increased dramatically the downside of this was an oversupply of labor which led to declining wages but not necessarily a decline in standards of living milton friedman notes that this time period resulted in more visible poor not the creation of more poor people economic liberals such as john locke adam smith and wilhelm von humboldt felt that the problems of an industrial society would correct themselves without government intervention in the one nine th century the voting franchise in most liberal democracies was extended and these newly enfranchised citizens often voted in favor of government solutions to the problems they faced in their everyday lives a rapid increase in literacy and the spread of knowledge led to social activism in a variety of forms social liberals demanded laws against child labor and laws requiring minimum standards of worker safety and a minimum wage the laissez faire economic liberals countered that such laws were an unjust imposition on life liberty and property not to mention a hindrance to economic development thus began the struggle on the one hand economic liberals who stress economic freedom and desire small governments on the other hand social liberals who stress equality of opportunity and desire a government large enough to protect citizens from the consequences of economic or natural difficulties that they consider too serious to be overcome without government aid this one nine th century social liberalism was the first significant split from classical liberalism by the end of the one nine th century a growing body of liberal thought asserted that in order to be free individuals needed access to the requirements of fulfillment including protection from exploitation and education in one nine one one l t hobhouse published liberalism which summarized the new liberalism including qualified acceptance of government intervention in the economy and the collective right to equality in dealings what he called just consent meanwhile the anti statist strain of liberalism was still alive and had become even more radical arguably a form of anarchism gustave de molinari in france and herbert spencer in england were prominent natural rights vs utilitarianism wilhelm von humboldtjohn stuart mill the german wilhelm von humboldt developed the modern concepts of liberalism in his book the limits of state action john stuart mill j s mill one eight zero six one eight seven three popularized and expanded these ideas in on liberty one eight five nine and other works he opposed collectivist tendencies while still placing emphasis on quality of life for the individual he also had sympathy for female suffrage and later in life for labor co operatives one of mill s most important contributions was his utilitarian justification of liberalism mill grounded liberal ideas in the instrumental and pragmatic allowing the unification of subjective ideas of liberty gained from the french thinkers in the tradition of jean jacques rousseau and the more rights based philosophies of john locke in the british tradition ironically while mill might be historically the last classical liberal his utilitarianism was a major factor in classical liberalism s popular decline the utilitarian notion of the public good began to overshadow the rights of the individual mill wrote in favor of providing the material educational and moral conditions for freedom to bloom war vs peace another dispute in liberalism which began in the late one nine th century was the attitude about war and peace classical liberalism was stridently anti imperialist what today we would call anti interventionist the just war theory of grotius was standard liberal fare and english liberals denounced british empire building in america thomas jefferson encapsulated non interventionism free trade with all entangling alliances with none after world war i president woodrow wilson jettisoned just war notions of neutrality and harm reduction wilson advocated collective security the idea that an alliance of states should put down aggressor states the league of nations wilson s brainchild failed after the u s congress refused to allow the united states to join but the idea was resurrected later in the form of the united nations most liberals today oppose unilateral war of one state on another state except in self defense many accept multilateral war carried out within a structure such as the united nations for such purposes as preventing genocide some accept wars for such purposes even without multilateral agreement or within the structure of nato liberalism and the great depression franklin d roosevelt although some dispute whether there was an actual laissez faire capitalist state in existance at the time the great depression of the one nine three zero s shook public faith in laissez faire capitalism and the profit motive leading many to conclude that the unregulated markets could not produce prosperity and prevent poverty many liberals were troubled by the political instability and restrictions on liberty that they believed were caused by the growing relative inequality of wealth key liberals of this persuasion such as john dewey john maynard keynes and franklin d roosevelt argued for the creation of a more elaborate state apparatus to serve as the bulwark of individual liberty permitting the continuation of capitalism while protecting the citizens against its perceived excesses some liberals including hayek whose work the road to serfdom remains influential argued against these institutions believing the great depression and second world war to be individual events that once passed did not justify a permanent change in the role of government lujo brentano key liberal thinkers such as lujo brentano leonard trelawny hobhouse thomas hill green john maynard keynes bertil ohlin and john dewey described how a government should intervene in the economy to protect liberty while avoiding socialism these liberals developed the theory of modern liberalism also new liberalism not to be confused with present day neoliberalism modern liberals rejected both radical capitalism and the revolutionary elements of the socialist school john maynard keynes in particular had a significant impact on liberal thought throughout the world the liberal party in britain particularly since lloyd george s people s budget was heavily influenced by keynes as was the liberal international the oxford liberal manifesto of one nine four seven of the world organization of liberal parties in the united states the influence of keynesianism on franklin d roosevelt s new deal has led modern liberalism to be identified with american liberalism and canadian liberalism other liberals including friedrich august von hayek milton friedman and ludwig von mises argued that the great depression was not a result of laissez faire capitalism but a result of too much government intervention and regulation upon the market in friedman s work capitalism and freedom he elucidated government regulation that occurred before the great depression including heavy regulations upon banks that prevented them he argued from reacting to the markets demand for money furthermore the u s federal government had created a fixed currency pegged to the value of gold this pegged value created a massive surplus of gold but later the pegged value was too low which created a massive migration of gold from the u s friedman and hayek both believed that this inability to react to currency demand created a run on the banks that the banks were no longer able to handle and that and the fixed exchange rates between the dollar and gold both worked to cause the great depression by creating and then not fixing deflationary pressures he further argued in this thesis that the government caused more pain upon the american public by first raising taxes then by printing money to pay debts thus causing inflation the combination of which helped to wipe out the savings of the middle class liberalism against totalitarianism in the mid two zero th century liberalism began to define itself in opposition to totalitarianism the term was first used by giovanni gentile to describe the socio political system set up by mussolini stalin would apply it to german nazism and after the war it became a descriptive term for what liberalism considered the common characteristics of fascist nazi and marxist leninist regimes totalitarian regimes sought and tried to implement absolute centralized control over all aspects of society in order to achieve prosperity and stability these governments often justified such absolutism by arguing that the survival of their civilization was at risk opposition to totalitarian regimes acquired great importance in liberal and democratic thinking and they were often portrayed as trying to destroy liberal democracy on the other hand the opponents of liberalism strongly objected to the classification that unified mutually hostile fascist and communist ideologies and considered them fundamentally different in italy and germany nationalist governments linked corporate capitalism to the state and promoted the idea that their nations were culturally and racially superior and that conquest would give them their rightful place in the sun the propaganda machines of these countries argued that democracy was weak and incapable of decisive action and that only a strong leader could impose necessary discipline in soviet union the ruling communists banned private property claiming to act for the sake of economic and social justice and the government had full control over the planned economy the regime insisted that personal interests be linked and inferior to those of the society of class which was ultimately an excuse for persecuting both oppositionals as well as dissidents within the communists ranks as well as arbitrary use of severe penal code isaiah berlin the rise of totalitarianism became a lens for liberal thought many liberals began to analyze their own beliefs and principles and came to the conclusion that totalitarianism arose because people in a degraded condition turn to dictatorships for solutions from this it was argued that the state had the duty to protect the economic well being of its citizens as isaiah berlin said freedom for the wolves means death for the sheep this growing body of liberal thought argued that reason requires a government to act as a balancing force in economics friedrich von hayek other liberal interpretations on the rise of totalitarianism were quite contrary to the growing body of thought on government regulation in supporting the market and capitalism this included friedrich hayek s work the road to serfdom he argued that the rise of totalitarian dictatorships was the result of too much government intervention and regulation upon the market which caused loss of political and civil freedoms hayek also saw these economic controls being instituted in the united kingdom and the united states and warned against these keynesian institutions believing that they can and will lead to the same totalitarian governments keynesians liberals were attempting to avoid hayek saw authoritarian regimes such as the fascist nazis and communists as the same totalitarian branch all of which sought the elimination or reduction of economic freedom to him the elimination of economic freedom brought about the elimination of political freedom thus hayek believes the differences between nazis and communists are only rhetorical friedrich von hayek and milton friedman stated that economic freedom is a necessary condition for the creation and sustainability of civil and political freedoms hayek believed the same totalitarian outcomes could occur in britain or anywhere else if the state sought to control the economic freedom of the individual with the policy prescriptions outlined by people like dewey keynes or roosevelt classical liberal studies by the canadian conservative free market oriented fraser institute the american conservative free market oriented heritage foundation and the wall street journal state that there is a relationship between economic freedom and political and civil freedoms to the extent claimed by friedrich von hayek they agree with hayek that those countries which restrict economic freedom ultimately restrict civil and political freedoms karl popper one of the most influential critics of totalitarianism was karl popper in the open society and its enemies he defended liberal democracy and advocated open society in which the government can be changed without bloodshed popper argued that the process of the accumulation of human knowledge is unpredictable and that the theory of ideal government cannot possibly exist therefore the political system should be flexible enough so that governmental policy would be able to evolve and adjust to the needs of the society in particular it should encourage pluralism and multiculturalism liberalism after world war ii in much of the west expressly liberal parties were caught between conservative parties on one hand and labor or social democratic parties on the other hand for example the uk liberal party became a minor party the same process occurred in a number of other countries as the social democratic parties took the leading role in the left wing while pro business conservative parties took the leading role in the right wing the post war period saw the dominance of modern liberalism linking modernism and progressivism to the notion that a populace in possession of rights and sufficient economic and educational means would be the best defense against totalitarian threats the liberalism of this period took the stance that by enlightened use of liberal institutions individual liberties could be maximized and self actualization could be reached by the broad use of technology liberal writers in this period include economist john kenneth galbraith philosopher john rawls and sociologist ralf dahrendorf a dissenting strain of thought developed that viewed any government involvement in the economy as a betrayal of liberal principles calling itself libertarianism this movement was centered around such schools of thought as austrian economics the debate between personal liberty and social optimality occupies much of the theory of liberalism since the second world war particularly centering around the questions of social choice and market mechanisms required to produce a liberal society one of the central parts of this argument concerns kenneth arrow s general possibility theorem this thesis states that there is no consistent social choice function which satisifies unbounded decision making independence of choices pareto optimality and non dictatorship in short according to the thesis it is not possible to have unlimited liberty a maximum amount of utility and an unlimited range of choices at the same time another important argument within liberalism is the importance of rationality in decision making whether the liberal state is best based on rigorous procedural rights or whether it should be rooted in substantial equality one important liberal debate concerns whether people have positive rights as members of communities in addition to being protected from wrongs done by others for many liberals the answer is yes individuals have positive rights based on being members of a national political or local unit and can expect protection and benefits from these associations members of a community have a right to expect that their community will to a certain degree regulate the economy since rising and falling economic circumstances cannot be controlled by the individual if individuals have a right to participate in a public capacity then they have a right to expect education and social protections against discrimination from other members of that public other liberals would answer no individuals have no such rights as members of communities for such rights conflict with the more fundamental negative rights of other members of the community after the one nine seven zero s the liberal pendulum had swung away from increasing the role of government and towards a greater use of the free market and laissez faire principles in essence many of the old pre world war i ideas were making a comeback in part this was a reaction to the triumphalism of the dominant forms of liberalism of the time but as well it was rooted in a foundation of liberal philosophy particularly suspicion of the state whether as an economic or philosophical actor even liberal institutions could be misused to restrict rather than promote liberty increasing emphasis on the free market emerged with milton friedman in the united states and with members of the austrian school in europe their argument was that regulation and government involvement in the economy was a slippery slope that any would lead to more and that more was difficult to remove the impact of liberalism in the modern world the impact of liberalism on the modern world is profound the ideas of individual liberties personal dignity free expression religious tolerance private property universal human rights transparency of government limitations on government power popular sovereignty national self determination privacy enlightened and rational policy the rule of law fundamental equality a free market economy and free trade were all radical notions some two five zero years ago liberal democracy in its typical form of multiparty political pluralism has spread to much of the world today all are accepted as the goals of policy in most nations even if there is a wide gap between statements and reality they are not only the goals of liberals but also of social democrats conservatives and christian democrats there is of course opposition see the headlines of critique contemporary liberalism a general overview of political positions today the word liberalism is used differently in different countries see liberalism worldwide one of the greatest contrasts is between the usage in the united states and usage in continental europe in the us liberalism is usually contrasted with conservatism and american liberals support broader tolerance and more readily embrace multiculturalism and affirmative action in europe on the other hand liberalism is not only contrasted with conservatism and christian democracy but also with socialism and social democracy in some countries european liberals share common positions with christian democrats before an explanation of this subject proceeds it is important to add this disclaimer there is always a disconnect between philosophical ideals and political realities also opponents of any belief are apt to describe that belief in different terms from those used by adherents what follows is a record of those goals that overtly appear most consistently across major liberal manifestos e g the oxford manifesto of one nine four seven it is not an attempt to catalogue the idiosyncratic views of particular persons parties or countries nor is it an attempt to investigate any covert goals since both are beyond the scope of this article most political parties which identify themselves as liberal claim to promote the rights and responsibilities of the individual free choice within an open competitive process the free market and the dual responsibility of the state to protect the individual citizen and guarantee their liberty critics of liberal parties tend to state liberal policies in different terms economic freedom may lead to gross inequality free speech may lead to speech that is obscene blasphemous or treasonous the role of the state as promoter of freedom and as protector of its citizens may come into conflict liberalism stresses the importance of representative liberal democracy as the best form of government elected representatives are subject to the rule of law and their power is moderated by a constitution which emphasizes the protection of rights and freedoms of individuals and limits the will of the majority liberals are in favour of a pluralist system in which differing political and social views even extreme or fringe views compete for political power on a democratic basis and have the opportunity to achieve power through periodically held elections they stress the resolution of differences by peaceful means within the bounds of democratic or lawful processes many liberals seek ways to increase the involvement and participation of citizens in the democratic process some liberals favour direct democracy instead of representative democracy main article liberal democracy liberalism advocates civil rights for all citizens the protection and privileges of personal liberty extended to all citizens equally by law it includes the equal treatment of all citizens irrespective of race gender and class liberals are divided over the extent to which positive rights are to be included such as the right to food shelter and education critics from an internationalist human rights school of thought argue that the civil rights advocated in the liberal view are not extended to all people but are limited to citizens of particular states unequal treatment on the basis of nationality is therefore possible especially in regard to citizenship itself main article civil rights the rule of law and equality before the law are fundamental to liberalism government authority may only be legitimately exercised in accordance with laws that are adopted through an established procedure another aspect of the rule of law is an insistence upon the guarantee of an independent judiciary whose political independence is intended to act as a safeguard against arbitrary rulings in individual cases the rule of law includes concepts such as the presumption of innocence no double jeopardy and habeas corpus rule of law is seen by liberals as a guard against despotism and as enforcing limitations on the power of government in the penal system liberals in general reject punishments they see as inhumane including capital punishment racism is incompatible with liberalism liberals in europe are generally hostile to any attempts by the state to enforce equality in employment by legal action against employers whereas in the united states many liberals favor such affirmative action liberals in general support equal opportunity but not necessarily equal outcome most european liberal parties do not favour employment quotas for women and ethnic minorities as the best way to end gender and racial inequality however all agree that arbitrary discrimination on the basis of race or gender is morally wrong economic liberals today stress the importance of a free market and free trade and seek to limit government intervention in both the domestic economy and foreign trade main article economic liberalism modern liberal movements often agree in principle with the idea of free trade but maintain some skepticism seeing unrestricted trade as leading to the growth of multi national corporations and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few in the post war consensus on the welfare state in europe liberals supported government responsibility for health education and alleviating poverty while still calling for a market based on independent exchange liberals agree that a high quality of health care and education should be available for all citizens but differ in their views on the degree to which governments should supply these benefits since poverty is a threat to personal liberty liberalism seeks a balance between individual responsibility and community responsibility in particular liberals favor special protection for the handicapped the sick the disabled and the aged european liberalism turned back to more laissez faire policies in the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s and supported privatisation and liberalisation in health care and other public sectors modern european liberals generally tend to believe in a smaller role for government than would be supported by most social democrats let alone socialists or communists the european liberal consensus appears to involve a belief that economies should be decentralized in general contemporary european liberals do not believe that the government should directly control any industrial production through state owned enterprises which places them in opposition to social democrats liberals generally believe in neutral government in the sense that it is not for the state to determine personal values as john rawls put it the state has no right to determine a particular conception of the good life in the united states this neutrality is expressed in the declaration of independence as the right to the pursuit of happiness both in europe and in the united states liberals often support the pro choice movement and advocate equal rights for women and homosexuals some liberal parties now oppose multiculturalism which they see damaging national unity others liberal parties embrace multiculturalism as enriching society but object to cultures which deny rights to women or to other ethnic groups and there are some liberals who argue for complete tolerance of all ethnic groups and oppose forcing any values such as women s rights on cultures that have different views many liberals share values with environmentalists such as the green party they seek to minimize the damage done by the human species on the natural world and to maximize the regeneration of damaged areas some such activists attempt to make changes on an economic level by acting together with businesses but others favor legislation in order to achieve sustainable development other liberals do not accept government regulation in this matter and argue that the market should regulate itself in some fashion main article green liberalism there is no consensus about liberal doctrine in international politics though there are some central notions which can be deduced from for example the opinions of liberal international social liberals often believe that war can be abolished some favor internationalism and support the united nations economic liberals on the other hand favor non interventionism rather than collective security liberals believe in the right of every individual to enjoy the essential human liberties and support self determination for national minorities essential also is the free exchange of ideas news goods and services between people as well as freedom of travel within and between all countries liberals generally oppose censorship protective trade barriers and exchange regulations some liberals were among the strongest advocates of international co operation and the building of supra national organizations such as the european union in the view of social liberals a global free and fair market can only work if companies worldwide respect a set of common minimal social and ecological standards a controversial question on which there is no liberal consensus is immigration do nations have a right to limit the flow of immigrants from countries with growing populations to countries with stable or declining populations political deviances recently however liberal parties in europe have begun to rethink their positions in response to the confrontation with radical forms of islam with political islamism they are confronted with a dilemma between respect for other cultures and individual rights liberalism traditionally holds that state and society should have very limited interests in the private behavior of its citizens in the areas of private sexual relations free speech personal conscience religious beliefs and political association european liberals are less willing to extend freedom to people who require others the wearing of the burqa arranged marriage and female circumcision which they see as contradictory to individual freedom especially for women many european liberals now think that the state should actively promote western values european values and or enlightenment values comparative critiques statist opponents of liberalism reject its emphasis on individual rights and instead emphasize the collective or the community to a degree where the rights of the individual are either diminished or abolished this position is called collectivism collectivism can be found both to the right and to the left of liberalism on the left the collective that tends to be enhanced is the state often in the form of state socialism on the right conservative and religious opponents argue that individual freedom in the non economic sphere can lead to indifference selfishness and immorality a softer critique of liberalism can be found in communitarianism which emphasizes a return to communities without necessarily denigrating individual rights beyond these clear theoretical differences some liberal principles can be treated piecemeal with some portions kept and others abandoned see liberal democracy and neoliberalism this ongoing process where putatively liberal agents accept some traditionally liberal values and reject others causes some critics to question whether or not the word liberal has any useful meaning at all in terms of international politics the universal claims of human rights which liberalism tends to endorse is disputed by rigid adherants of non interventionism since intervention in the interests of human rights can conflict with the sovereignty of countries by contrast world federalists criticize liberalism for its adherance to the doctrine of sovereign nation states which the world federalists believe is not helpful in the face of genocide and other mass human rights abuses left leaning opponents of economic liberalism reject the view that the private sector can be for the collective benefit often citing the harm done to those individuals who lose out in competition they oppose the use of the state to impose market principles on non liberals usually through an enforced market mechanism in a previously non market sector they argue that the dominance of liberal principles in economy and society has contributed to inequality among states and inequality within states they argue that liberal societies are characterised by long term poverty and by ethnic and class differentials in health infant mortality and life expectancy some would even say they have much higher unemployment than centrally planned economies liberalism shares many basic goals and methods with social democracy but in some places diverges the fundamental difference between liberalism and social democracy is a disagreement over the role of the state in the economy social democracy can be understood to be the common trait or broader ideology that overlaps between social liberalism and democratic socialism democratic socialism seeks to achieve some minimum equality of outcome democratic socialists support a large public sector and the nationalization of utilities such as gas and electricity in order to avoid private monopolies and to achieve social justice and to raise the standard of living by contrast liberalism in its distrust of monopolies both public and private prefers much less state intervention choosing for example subsidies and regulation rather than outright nationalization liberalism also emphasizes equality of opportunity and not equality of outcome citing the desire for a meritocracy anti statist critiques of liberalism like some forms of anarchism emphasize the illegitimacy of the state for any purposes liberal conservatism see main article liberal conservatism liberal conservatism is a hybrid of economic liberalism and conservative social philosophy this strain often emerged in countries with strong socialist and or labour parties and is often strongly influenced by the writings of edmund burke examples include the reform party of canada canadian alliance fine gael republic of ireland party of the liberal front brazil moderate party sweden the liberal democratic party japan and the liberal party of australia liberal international relations theory liberalism in international relations is a theory that holds that state preferences rather than state capabilities are the primary determinant of state behavior unlike realism where the state is seen as a unitary actor liberalism allows for plurality in state actions thus preferences will vary from state to state depending on factors such as culture economic system or government type liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political security high politics but also economic cultural low politics whether through commercial firms organizations or individuals thus instead of an anarchic international system there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power such as cultural capital for example the influence of a country s films leading to the popularity of its culture and the creation of a market for its exports worldwide another assumption is that absolute gains can be made through co operation and interdependence thus peace can be achieved liberalism as an international relations theory is not inherently linked to liberalism as a more general domestic political ideology increasingly modern liberals are integrating critical international relations theory into their foreign policy positions neoliberalism see main article neoliberalism neoliberalism is an economic ideology rather than a broader political ideology the swing away from government action in the one nine seven zero s led to the introduction of this term which refers to a program of reducing trade barriers and internal market restrictions while using government power to enforce opening of foreign markets this is strongly opposed by economic liberals who favor a free market and free trade neoliberalism accepts a certain degree of government involvement in the domestic economy particularly a central bank with the power to print fiat money it also favors an interventionist military while neoliberalism is sometimes described as overlapping with thatcherism economists as diverse as joseph stiglitz and milton friedman have been described by others as neoliberal this economic agenda is not necessarily combined with a liberal agenda in politics neoliberals often do not subscribe to individual liberty on ethical issues or in sexual mores an extreme example was the pinochet regime in chile but some also classify ronald reagan margaret thatcher and even tony blair and gerhard schr der as being neo liberal it should be noted that in the one nine nine zero s many social democratic parties adopted neoliberal economic policies such as privatization of industry and open markets much to the dismay of many of their own voters this has led these parties to become de facto neoliberal and has often resulted in a drastic loss of popular support for example critics to the left of the german social democratic party and the british labour party accuse them of pursuing neoliberal policies by refusing to renationalise industry as a result of this much support for these parties has been lost to the christian democratic union and the liberal democrats respectively sometimes neoliberalism is used as a catch all term for the anti socialist reaction which swept through some countries during the period between the seven zero s and nine zero s neoliberalism in the form of thatcher reagan and pinochet claimed to move from a bureacratic welfare based society toward a meritocracy acting in the interests of business in actuality these governments cut funding for education and taxed income more heavily than wealth which increased the influence of big business and the upper class some conservatives see themselves as the true inheritors of classical liberalism jonah goldberg of national review argues that most conservatives are closer to classical liberals than a lot of reason libertarians because conservatives want to preserve some institutions that they see as needed for liberty further confusing the classification of liberalism and conservatism is that some conservatives claim liberal values as their own see also conservatism anarcho capitalism

are typically used in offices or across university campuses a lan enables the fast and effective transfer of information within a group of users and reduces operational costs see network other connected computer resources are wide area networks wans and private branch exchanges pbxs wans are similar to lans but they connect computers separated by longer distances typically across the country or internationally and they use specialized and expensive hardware and leased communications services pbxs provide continuous computer connections for the transfer of specialized data such as telephone transmissions but they are not ideally suited to send and receive the short bursts of data used by most computer applications history in the days before personal computers a site might have just one central computer with users accessing this via computer terminals over simple low speed cabling networks such as ibm s sna systems network architecture were aimed at linking terminals or other mainframes at remote sites over leased lines hence these were wide area networks the first lans were created in the late one nine seven zero s and used to create high speed links between several large central computers at one site of many competing systems created at this time ethernet and arcnet were the most popular the growth of cp m and then dos based personal computer meant that a single site began to have dozens or even hundreds of computers the initial attraction of networking these was generally to share disk space and laser printers which were both very expensive at the time there was much enthusiasm for the concept and for several years from about one nine eight three onward computer industry pundits would regularly declare the coming year to be the year of the lan in reality the concept was marred by proliferation of incompatible physical layer and network protocol implementations and confusion over how best to share resources typically each vendor would have their own

microbiologist and chemist he is known most famously for his demonstrations supporting the germ theory of disease and his vaccinations most notably the first vaccine against rabies however he also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry most notably the asymmetry of crystals early life pasteur was born in dole also ole in the jura region of france and grew up in the town of arbois his father jean pasteur was a tanner and a veteran of the napoleonic wars louis aptitude was recognised by his college headmaster who recommended that the young man apply for the cole normale sup rieure which accepted him after serving briefly as professor of physics at dijon lycee in one eight four eight he became professor of chemistry at strasbourg university where he met and married marie laurent daughter of the university s rector in one eight four nine together they had five children only two of whom survived to adulthood throughout his life louis pasteur remained a devout christian work on chirality and the polarization of light in pasteur s early works as a chemist he resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid one eight four nine a solution of this compound derived from living things specifically wine lees rotated the plane of polarization of light passing through it the mystery was that tartaric acid derived by chemical synthesis had no such effect even though its reactions were identical and its elemental composition was the same pasteur s experiment proved paratartrate does not rotate polarized light while tartrate does upon examination of the miniscule crystals of tartaric acid pasteur noticed the crystals came in two asymmetric forms that were mirror images of one another tediously sorting the crystals by hand gave two forms of tartaric acid solutions of one form rotated polarised light clockwise while the other form rotated light counterclockwise an equal mix of the two had no polarizing effect on light pasteur correctly deduced the tartaric acid molecule was asymmetric and could exist in two different forms that resemble one another as would left and right hand gloves as the first demonstration of chiral molecules it was quite an achievement but pasteur then went on to his more famous work in the field of biology medicine pasteur separated the left and right crystal shapes from each other to form two piles of crystals in solution one form rotated light to the left the other to the right while an equal mixture of the two forms cancels each other s rotation hence the mixture does not rotate polarized light pasteur s doctoral thesis on crystallography garnered him a position of professor of chemistry at the facult college of strasbourg in one eight five four he was named dean of the new college of science in lille in one eight five six he was made administrator and director of scientific studies of the cole normale sup rieure germ theory louis pasteur demonstrated that the fermentation process is caused by the growth of microorganisms and that the growth of microorganisms in nutrient broths is not due to spontaneous generation modified version of florence flask swan flask made by pasteur in his experiment for disproving spontaneous generation theory he exposed boiled broths to air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium and even in vessels with no filter at all with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not allow dust particles to pass nothing grew in the broths therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside as spores on dust rather than spontaneously generated within the broth thus pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported germ theory while pasteur did not develop germ theory girolamo fracastoro friedrich henle and others had suggested it earlier he conducted experiments that clearly indicated its correctness and managed to convince most of europe it was true louis pasteur and his device for germ experiment pasteur s research also showed that some microorganisms contaminated fermenting beverages with this established he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to kill all bacteria and molds already present within them he and claude bernard completed the first test on april two zero one eight six two this process was soon afterwards known as pasteurization beverage contamination led pasteur to conclude that microorganisms infected animals and humans as well he proposed preventing the entry of microorganisms into the human body leading joseph lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery in one eight six five two parasitic diseases called p brine and flacherie were killing great numbers of silkworms pasteur worked several years proving it was a microbe attacking silkworm eggs which caused the disease and that eliminating this microbe within silkworm nurseries would eradicate the disease pasteur also discovered anaerobiosis whereby some microorganisms can develop and live without air or oxygen immunology pasteur s later work on diseases included work on chicken cholera during this work a culture of the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was infecting with the disease upon reusing these healthy chickens pasteur discovered that he could not infect them even with fresh bacteria the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease although they had not actually caused the disease this discovery was an accident his assistant charles chamberland had been instructed to inoculate the chickens after pasteur went on holiday chamberland failed to do this but instead went on holiday himself on his return the month old cultures made the chickens unwell but instead of the infection being fatal as usual the chickens recovered completely chamberland assumed an error had been made and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture out when pasteur stopped him pasteur guessed the recovered animals now might be immune to the disease as were the animals at eure et loir that had recovered from anthrax in the one eight seven zero s he applied this immunization method to anthrax which affected cattle and aroused interest in combating other diseases louis pasteur in his laboratory painting by a edelfeldt in one eight eight five pasteur publically claimed he had made the anthrax vaccine by exposing the bacilus to oxygen his laboratory notebooks now in the bibliotheque nationale in paris in fact show pasteur used the method of rival jean joseph henri toussaint a toulouse veterinary surgeon to create the anthrax vaccine this method used the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate pasteur s oxygen method did eventually produce a vaccine but only after he had been awarded a patent on the production of an anthrax vaccine the notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new this had been known for a long time for smallpox inoculation with smallpox was known to result in far less scarring and greatly reduced mortality in comparison to the naturally acquired disease edward jenner had also discovered vaccination using cowpox to give cross immunity to smallpox and by pasteur s time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox material in inoculation the difference with chicken cholera and anthrax was that the weakened form of the disease organism had been generated artificially and so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found this discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases and pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of vaccines to honour jenner s discovery pasteur produced the first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue the rabies vaccine was initially created by emile roux a french doctor and a colleague of pasteur who had been working with a killed vaccine produced by desiccating the spinal cords of infected rabbits the vaccine had only been tested on eleven dogs before its first human trial this vaccine was first used on nine year old joseph meister on july six one eight eight five after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog this was done at some personal risk for pasteur since he was not a licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy fortunately the treatment proved to be a spectacular success with meister avoiding the disease thus pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued the treatment s success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines the first of the pasteur institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement honors and final days louis pasteur portrait in his later years pasteur won the leeuwenhoek medal microbiology s highest honor in one eight nine five he died in one eight nine five near paris from complications caused by a series of strokes that had begun plaguing him as far back as one eight six eight he was buried in the cathedral of notre dame but his remains were soon placed in a crypt in the institut pasteur paris legacy pasteur s method of immunization was effective and was employed by many other physicians eventually leading to the eradication of typhus and polio as threats pasteurization led to the elimination of contaminated milk and other drinks as sources of disease in fact pasteur inaugurated the modern age of medicine leading to an increase in the human life span and a surprising population explosion accordingly he has been hailed as the father of medicine and a benefactor of humanity craters on mars and the moon are named in his honor in popular culture pasteur is the eponymous french scientist his name appearing in science fiction shows like star trek a biographical film of his life has also been made entitled the story of louis pasteur miscellaneous facts one of the few streets in saigon vietnam that has not been renamed since colonial times is named in honor of pasteur also a square in

johann wittgenstein april two six one eight eight nine april two nine one nine five one was an austrian philosopher who contributed several ground breaking works to modern philosophy primarily on the foundations of logic the philosophy of mathematics the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind he is widely regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the two zero th century although numerous collections from wittgenstein s notebooks papers and lectures have been published since his death he published only one philosophical book in his lifetime the tractatus logico philosophicus in one nine two one wittgenstein s early work was deeply influenced by arthur schopenhauer and by the new systems of logic put forward by bertrand russell and gottlob frege when the tractatus was published it was taken up as a major influence by the vienna circle positivists however wittgenstein did not consider himself part of that school and alleged that logical positivism involved grave misunderstandings of the tractatus with the completion of the tractatus wittgenstein believed he had solved all the problems of philosophy and he abandoned his studies working as a schoolteacher a gardener at a monastery and an architect along with paul engelmann on his sister s new house in vienna however in one nine two nine he returned to cambridge was awarded a ph d for the tractatus and took a teaching position there he renounced or revised much of his earlier work and his development of a new philosophical method and a new understanding of language culminated in his second magnum opus the philosophical investigations which was published posthumously both his early and later work have been major influences in the development of analytic philosophy former students and colleagues who carried on wittgenstein s methods include gilbert ryle friedrich waismann norman malcolm g e m anscombe rush rhees georg henrik von wright and peter geach contemporary philosophers heavily influenced by him include michael dummett peter hacker john searle saul kripke john mcdowell hilary putnam anthony quinton peter strawson paul horwich colin mcginn daniel dennett richard rorty stanley cavell cora diamond and james f conant with others the latter three have been associated with an interpretation of wittgenstein sometimes known as the new wittgenstein life ludwig joseph johann wittgenstein was born in vienna on april two six one eight eight nine to karl and leopoldine wittgenstein he was the youngest of eight children born into one of the most prominent and wealthy families in the austro hungarian empire his father s parents hermann christian and fanny wittgenstein were born into jewish families but converted to protestantism and after they moved from saxony to vienna in the one eight five zero s assimilated themselves into the viennese protestant professional classes ludwig s father karl wittgenstein became an industrialist and went on to make a fortune in iron and steel ludwig s mother leopoldine n e kalmus was also of jewish descent on her father s side but had been brought up as a practising roman catholic ludwig like all his brothers and sisters was baptized as a roman catholic and was given a catholic burial by his friends when he died early life ludwig grew up in a household that provided an astonishingly intense environment for artistic and intellectual achievement his parents were both very musical and all their children were artistically and intellectually gifted karl wittgenstein was a leading patron of the arts and the wittgenstein house hosted many figures of high culture above all musicians the family was often visited by artists such as johannes brahms and gustav mahler ludwig s brother paul wittgenstein went on to become a world famous concert pianist even after losing his right arm in world war i ludwig himself did not have prodigious musical talent but his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings and was said to be unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages a less fortunate family trait was a tendency to intense self criticism to the point of depression and suicidal tendencies three of his four brothers committed suicide until one nine zero three ludwig was educated at home after that he began three years of schooling at the realschule in linz a school emphasizing technical topics adolf hitler was a student there at the same time and the two of them both one four or one five years old can be seen together in a school photograph with about four zero other students one ludwig was interested in physics and wanted to study with ludwig boltzmann whose collection of popular writings including an inspiring essay about the hero and genius who would solve the problem of heavier than air flight on aeronautics was published during this time one nine zero five sterrett two zero zero five seven five boltzmann committed suicide in one nine zero six however in one nine zero six wittgenstein began studying mechanical engineering in berlin and in one nine zero eight he went to the victoria university of manchester to study for his doctorate in engineering full of plans for aeronautical projects he registered as a research student in an engineering laboratory where he conducted research on the behaviour of kites in the upper atmosphere and worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades during his research in manchester he became interested in the foundations of mathematics particularly after reading bertrand russell s principles of mathematics and gottlob frege s grundgesetze in the summer of one nine one one wittgenstein visited frege after having corresponded with him for some time and frege advised him to go to the university of cambridge to study under russell in october one nine one one wittgenstein arrived unannounced at russell s rooms in trinity college and was soon attending his lectures and discussing philosophy with him at great length he made a great impression on russell and g e moore and started to work on the foundations of logic and mathematical logic russell was increasingly tired of philosophy and saw wittgenstein as a successor who would carry on his work during this period wittgenstein s other major interests were music and travelling often in the company of david pinsent an undergraduate who became a firm friend he was also invited to join the elite secret society the cambridge apostles which russell and moore had both belonged to as students in one nine one three wittgenstein inherited a great fortune when his father died he donated some of it initially anonymously to austrian artists and writers including rainer maria rilke and georg trakl in one nine one four he went to visit trakl when the latter wanted to meet his benefactor but trakl killed himself days before wittgenstein arrived although he was invigorated by his study in cambridge and his conversations with russell wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics in one nine one three he retreated to the solitude of a remote mountain cabin in skjolden norway which could only be reached on horseback the isolation allowed him to devote himself entirely to his work and he later saw this period as one of the most passionate and productive times of his life while there he wrote a ground breaking work in the foundations of logic a book entitled logik which was the immediate predecessor and source of much of the tractatus logico philosophicus world war i the outbreak of world war i in the next year took him completely by surprise as he was living a secluded life at the time he volunteered for the austro hungarian army as a private soldier first serving on a ship and then in an artillery workshop in one nine one six he was sent as a member of a howitzer regiment to the russian front where he won several medals for bravery the diary entries of this time reflect his contempt for the baseness as he saw it of his fellow soldiers throughout the war wittgenstein kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical and religious reflections alongside personal remarks the notebooks reflect a profound change in his religious life a militant atheist during his stint at cambridge monk one nine nine zero four four wittgenstein discovered leo tolstoy s the gospel in brief at a bookshop in galicia he devoured tolstoy s commentary and became an evangelist of sorts he carried the book everywhere he went and recommended it to anyone in distress to the point that he became known to his fellow soldiers as the man with the gospels monk one nine nine zero one one six the gospel in brief is philosophical and practical rather than theological or spiritual in its intention although monk notes that wittgenstein began to doubt by at least one nine three seven monk one nine nine zero three eight two three eight four and that by the end of his life he said he could not believe christian doctrines although religious belief remained an important preoccupation this is not contrary to the influence that tolstoy had on his philosophy developing the tractatus wittgenstein s work on logik began to take on an ethical and religious significance with this new concern with the ethical combined with his earlier interest in logical analysis and with key insights developed during the war such as the so called picture theory of propositions wittgenstein s work from cambridge and norway was transfigured into the material that eventually became the tractatus in one nine one eight toward the end of the war wittgenstein was promoted to reserve officer lieutenant and sent to north italy as part of an artillery regiment on leave in the summer of one nine one eight he received a letter from david pinsent s mother telling wittgenstein that her son had been killed in an airplane accident suicidal wittgenstein went to stay with his uncle paul and completed the tractatus which was dedicated to pinsent in a letter to mrs pinsent wittgenstein said only in him did i find a real friend the book was sent to publishers at this time without success in october wittgenstein returned to italy and was captured by the italians through the intervention of his cambridge friends russell keynes and pinsent had corresponded with him throughout the war via switzerland wittgenstein managed to get access to books prepare his manuscript and send it back to england russell recognized it as a work of supreme philosophical importance and after wittgenstein s release in one nine one nine he worked with wittgenstein to get it published an english translation was prepared first by frank p ramsey and then by c k ogden with wittgenstein s involvement after some discussion of how best to translate the title g e moore suggested tractatus logico philosophicus in an allusion to baruch spinoza s tractatus theologico politicus russell wrote an introduction lending the book his reputation as one of the foremost philosophers in the world however difficulties remained wittgenstein had become personally disaffected with russell and he was displeased with russell s introduction which he thought evinced fundamental misunderstandings of the tractatus wittgenstein grew frustrated as interested publishers proved difficult to find to add insult to injury those publishers who were interested proved to be mainly interested in the book because of russell s introduction at last wittgenstein found a publisher in wilhelm ostwald s journal annalen der naturphilosophie which printed a german edition in one nine two one and in routledge kegan paul which printed a bilingual edition with russell s introduction and the ramsey ogden translation in one nine two two the lost years life after the tractatus at the same time wittgenstein was a profoundly changed man he had embraced the christianity which previously he had opposed faced harrowing combat in world war i and succeeded in crystallizing the upheavals in his intellectual and emotional life with the exhausting composition of the tractatus it was a work which transfigured all of his past work on logic into a radically new framework that he believed offered a definitive solution to all the problems of philosophy these changes in wittgenstein s inner and outer life left him both haunted and yet invigorated to follow a new ascetic life one of the most dramatic expressions of this change was his decision in one nine one nine to give away his portion of the family fortune that he had inherited when his father had died the money was divided between his sisters helene and hermine and his brother paul and wittgenstein insisted that they promise never to give it back he felt that giving money to the poor could only corrupt them further the rich would not be harmed by it since wittgenstein thought that the tractatus had solved all the problems of philosophy he left philosophy and returned to austria to train as a primary school teacher he was educated in the methods of the austrian school reform movement which advocated the stimulation of the natural curiosity of children and their development as independent thinkers instead of just letting them memorize facts wittgenstein was enthusiastic about these ideas but ran into problems when he was appointed as an elementary teacher in the rural austrian villages of trattenbach puchberg am schneeberg and otterthal during his time as a schoolteacher wittgenstein wrote a pronunciation and spelling dictionary for his use in teaching students it was published and well received by his colleagues this would be the only book besides the tractatus that wittgenstein published in his lifetime wittgenstein had unrealistic expectations of the rural children he taught and his teaching methods were intense and exacting he had little patience with those children who had no aptitude for mathematics however he achieved good results with children attuned to his interests and style of teaching especially boys his severe disciplinary methods often involving corporal punishment as well as a general suspicion amongst the villagers that he was somewhat mad led to a long series of bitter disagreements with some of his students parents and eventually culminated in april one nine two six in the collapse of an eleven year old boy whom wittgenstein had struck on the head the boy s father attempted to have wittgenstein arrested and despite being cleared of misconduct he resigned his position and returned to vienna feeling that he had failed as a school teacher after abandoning his work as a school teacher wittgenstein worked as a gardener s assistant in a monastery near vienna he considered becoming a monk and went so far as to inquire about the requirements for joining an order however at the interview he was advised that he could not find in monastic life what he sought two major developments helped to save wittgenstein from this despairing state the first was an invitation from his sister margaret gretl stonborough who was painted by gustav klimt in one nine zero five to work on the design and construction of her new house he worked with the architect paul engelmann who had become a close friend of wittgenstein s during the war and the two designed a spare modernist house after the style of adolf loos whom they both greatly admired wittgenstein found the work intellectually absorbing and exhausting he poured himself into the design in painstaking detail including even small aspects such as doorknobs and radiators which had to be exactly positioned to maintain the symmetry of the rooms as a work of modernist architecture the house evoked some high praise g h von wright said that it possessed the same static beauty as the tractatus the effort of totally involving himself in intellectual work once again did much to restore wittgenstein s spirits secondly toward the end of his work on the house wittgenstein was contacted by moritz schlick one of the leading figures of the newly formed vienna circle the tractatus had been tremendously influential to the development of the vienna positivism and although schlick never succeeded in drawing wittgenstein into the discussions of the vienna circle itself he and some of his fellow circle members especially friedrich waismann met occasionally with wittgenstein to discuss philosophical topics wittgenstein was frequently frustrated by these meetings he believed that schlick and his colleagues had fundamentally misunderstood the tractatus and at times would refuse to talk about it at all much of the disagreements concerned the importance of religious life and the mystical wittgenstein considered these matters of a sort of wordless faith whereas the positivists disdained them as useless in one meeting wittgenstein refused to discuss the tractatus at all and sat with his back to his guests while he read aloud from the poetry of rabindranath tagore nevertheless the contact with the vienna circle stimulated wittgenstein intellectually and revived his interest in philosophy he also met with frank p ramsey a young philosopher of mathematics who travelled several times from cambridge to austria to meet with wittgenstein and the vienna circle in the course of his conversations with the vienna circle and with ramsey wittgenstein began to think that there might be some grave mistakes in his work as presented in the tractatus marking the beginning of a second career of ground breaking philosophical work which would occupy him for the rest of his life returning to cambridge in one nine two nine he decided at the urging of ramsey and others to return to cambridge he was met at the train station by a crowd of england s greatest intellectuals discovering rather to his horror that he was one of the most famed philosophers in the world in a letter to his wife lydia lopokova lord keynes wrote well god has arrived i met him on the five one five train despite this fame he could not initially work at cambridge as he did not have a degree so he applied as an advanced undergraduate russell noted that his previous residency was in fact sufficient for a doctoral degree and urged him to offer the tractatus as a doctoral thesis which he did in one nine two nine it was examined by russell and moore at the end of the thesis defence wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said don t worry i know you ll never understand it moore commented in the examiner s report to the effect that in my opinion this is a work of genius it is in any case up to the standards of a degree from cambridge wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of trinity college although wittgenstein was involved in a relationship with marguerite respinger a young swiss woman whom he had met as a friend of the family his plans to marry marguerite were broken off in one nine three one and wittgenstein never married most of his romantic attachments were to young men there is considerable debate over how active wittgenstein s homosexual life was inspired by w w bartley s claim to have found evidence of not only active homosexuality but in particular several casual liasons with young men in the wiener prater park during his time in vienna bartley published his claims in a biography of wittgenstein in one nine seven three claiming to have his information from confidential reports from friends of wittgenstein bartley one six zero whom he declined to name and to have discovered two coded notebooks unknown to wittgenstein s executors that detailed the visits to the prater wittgenstein s estate and other biographers have disputed bartley s claims and asked him to produce the sources that he claims what has become clear in any case is that wittgenstein had several long term homoerotic attachments including an infatuation with his friend david pinsent and long term relationships during his years in cambridge with francis skinner and possibly ben richards wittgenstein s political sympathies lay on the left wing politics and while he was opposed to marxist theory he described himself as a communist at heart and romanticized the life of labourers in one nine three four attracted by keynes description of soviet life in short view of russia he conceived the idea of emigrating to the soviet union with skinner they took lessons in russian and in one nine three five wittgenstein travelled to leningrad and moscow in an attempt to secure employment he was offered teaching positions but preferred manual work and returned three weeks later from one nine three six to one nine three seven wittgenstein lived again in norway leaving skinner behind he worked on the philosophical investigations in the winter of one nine three six three seven he delivered a series of confessions to close friends most of them about minor infractions in an effort to cleanse himself in one nine three eight he travelled to ireland to visit maurice drury a friend who was training as a doctor and considered such training himself with the intention of abandoning philosophy for psychiatry while in ireland the anschluss took place wittgenstein was now technically a german citizen and a jew under the german racial laws while he found this intolerable and started to investigate the possibilities of acquiring british or irish citizenship with the help of keynes it put his siblings hermine helene and paul all still residing in austria in considerable danger wittgenstein s first thought was to travel to vienna but he was dissuaded by friends had the wittgensteins been classified as jews their fate would have been no different from that of any other austrian jews of approximately six zero zero in linz at the end of the one nine three zero s for example only two six survived the war their only hope was to be classified as mischlinge officially aryan jewish mongrels whose treatment while harsh was less brutal than that reserved for jews this reclassification was known as a befreiung the successful conclusion of these negotiations required the personal approval of adolf hitler the figures show how difficult it was to gain a befreiung in one nine three nine there were two one zero zero applications for a different racial classification the f hrer allowed only twelve edmonds and eidinow p one zero five gretl an american citizen by marriage started negotiations with the nazi authorities over the racial status of their grandfather hermann claiming that he was the illegitimate son of an aryan since the reichsbank was keen to get its hands on the large amounts of foreign currency owned by the wittgenstein family this was used as a bargaining tool paul who had escaped to switzerland and then the united states in july one nine three eight disagreed with the family s stance after g e moore s resignation in one nine three nine wittgenstein who was by then considered a philosophical genius was appointed to the chair in philosophy at cambridge he acquired british citizenship soon afterwards and in july one nine three nine he travelled to vienna to assist gretl and his other sisters visiting berlin for one day to meet with an official of the reichsbank after this he travelled to new york to persuade paul whose agreement was required to back the scheme the required befreiung was granted in august one nine three nine the amount signed over to the nazis by paul wittgenstein a week or so before the outbreak of war was one seven tonnes of gold two of the austrian national gold reserves after exhausting philosophical work wittgenstein would often relax by watching an american western or reading detective stories these tastes are in stark contrast to his preferences in music where he rejected anything after brahms as a symptom of the decay of society by this time wittgenstein s view on the foundations of mathematics had changed considerably earlier he had thought that logic could provide a solid foundation and he had even considered updating russell and whitehead s principia mathematica now he denied that there were any mathematical facts to be discovered and he denied that mathematical statements were true in any real sense they simply expressed the conventional established meanings of certain symbols he also denied that a contradiction should count as a fatal flaw of a mathematical system he gave a series of lectures which were attended by alan turing and in which the two argued vigorously about these matters during world war ii he left cambridge and volunteered as a hospital porter in guy s hospital in london and as a laboratory assistant in newcastle upon tyne s royal victoria infirmary this was arranged by his friend john ryle a brother of the philosopher gilbert ryle who was then working at the hospital after the war wittgenstein returned to teach at cambridge but he found teaching an increasing burden he had never liked the intellectual atmosphere at cambridge and in fact encouraged several of his students to find work outside of academic philosophy there are stories perhaps apocryphal that if any of his philosophy students expressed an interest in pursuing the subject he would ban them from attending any more of his classes final years wittgenstein s grave lies in the chapel for ascension parish burial ground in cambridge wittgenstein resigned his position at cambridge in one nine four seven in order to concentrate on his writing he was succeeded as professor by his friend georg henrik von wright much of his later work was done in the rural isolation that he preferred on the west coast of ireland by one nine four nine when he was diagnosed as having prostate cancer he had written most of the material that would be published after his death as philosophische untersuchungen philosophical investigations which arguably contains his most important work he spent the last two years of his life working in vienna the united states oxford and cambridge he worked continuously on new material inspired by the conversations that he had had with his friend and former student norman malcolm during a long vacation at the malcolms house in the united states malcolm had been wrestling with g e moore s common sense response to external world skepticism here is one hand and here is another therefore i know at least two external things exist wittgenstein began to work on another series of remarks inspired by his conversations which he continued to work on until two days before his death the remarks would be collected and published posthumously as on certainty the only known fragment of music composed by wittgenstein was premiered in november two zero zero three it is a piece of music that lasts less than half a minute wittgenstein died from prostate cancer at his doctor s home in cambridge in one nine five one just a few days before his friends arrived to pay their last respects his last words were tell them i ve had a wonderful life work the tractatus main article tractatus logico philosophicus in rough order the first half of the book sets forth the following theses the world consists of independent atomic facts existing states of affairs out of which larger facts are built language consists of atomic and then larger scale propositions that correspond to these facts by sharing the same logical form thought expressed in language pictures these facts we can analyse our thoughts and sentences to express express as in show not say their true logical form those we cannot so analyse cannot be meaningfully discussed philosophy consists of no more than this form of analysis wovon man nicht sprechen kann dar ber mu man schweigen whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent some commentators believe that although no other type of discourse is properly speaking philosophy wittgenstein does imply that those things to be passed over in silence may be important or useful according to some of his more cryptic propositions in the last sections of the tractatus indeed may be the most important and most useful other commentators point out that the sentences of the tractatus would not qualify as meaningful according to its own rigid criteria and that wittgenstein s method in the book does not follow its own demands regarding the only strictly correct philosophical method these commentators believe that the book is deeply ironical and that it demonstrates the ultimate nonsensicality of any sentence attempting to say something philosophical something about those fixations of philosophers about those things that must be passed over in silence and about logic the work also contains several innovations in logic including the truth table intermediary works wittgenstein wrote copiously after his return to cambridge and arranged much of his writing into an array of incomplete manuscripts some thirty thousand pages existed at the time of his death much but by no means all of this has been sorted and released in several volumes during his middle work in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s much of his work involved attacks from various angles on the sort of philosophical perfectionism embodied in the tractatus of this work wittgenstein published only a single paper remarks on logical form which was submitted to be read for the aristotelian society and published in their proceedings by the time of the conference however wittgenstein had repudiated the essay as worthless and gave a talk on the concept of infinity instead wittgenstein was increasingly frustrated to find that although he was not yet ready to publish his work some other philosophers were beginning to publish essays containing inaccurate presentations of his own views based on their conversations with him as a result he published a very brief letter to the journal mind taking a recent article by r b braithwaite as a case in point and asked philosophers to hold off writing about his views until he was himself ready to publish them although unpublished the blue book a set of notes dictated to his class at cambridge in one nine three three one nine three four contains seeds of wittgenstein s later thoughts on language later developed in the investigations and is widely read today as a turning point in his philosophy of language the philosophical investigations main article philosophical investigations although the tractatus is a major work of philosophy it is for the philosophical investigations known as philosophische untersuchungen in german that wittgenstein is best known today published posthumously in one nine five three philosophical investigations comprises two parts part i consisting of six nine three numbered paragraphs which was ready for printing in one nine four six but was withdrawn from the publisher by wittgenstein and part ii which was added on by the editors trustees of his estate it is notoriously difficult to find consensus among interpreters of wittgenstein s work and this is particularly true concerning philosophical investigations what follows then is but one of many readings to be found in philosophical investigations wittgenstein presents a picture of our use of language which he sees as crucial to the practice of doing philosophy in brief wittgenstein describes language as a set of language games within which the words of our language function and receive their meaning this view of meaning as use represents a break from the classical view also presented by wittgenstein in the tractatus of meaning as representation one of the most radical characteristics of later wittgenstein is his view of the task of philosophy the conventional view of philosophy accepted by almost every western philosopher since plato is that the philosopher s task was to solve a number of seemingly intractable problems using logical analysis for example the problem of free will the relationship between mind and matter what is the good or the beautiful and so on however wittgenstein argued in philosophical investigations that these problems were in fact pseudo problems that arose from philosophers misuse of language the point can be made as follows language has evolved as a way to cope with everyday problems and it functions well within the context in which it has arisen but when everyday language is made to accomodate something beyond the domain of the everyday we can expect problems to arise to take a simple example if someone on the street asks what time is it there is usually a straightforward answer but if a person were to ask what is time the situation would be quite different the bottom line in this case is that while what is time might be a valid question in the context of traditional metaphysics it is effectively a question to which there is no answer since language is seen on this view as determinative of the possibilities of thought and thus wittgenstein would say it is not properly speaking a question at all at the very least it is not a question which philosophers ought to be trying to answer wittgenstein s new philosophical methodology was to continually remind his readers of certain aspects of linguistic usage that had been forgotten in the search for metaphysical truths the primary aspect among these being that everyday language functions for the most part unproblematically and does not require correction by philosophers in this manner he aimed to demonstrate that the great questions posed by philosophers had arisen because they were operating on a mistaken view of language and its relation to reality philosophers in the western tradition were not wiser than anyone else as had been assumed they were simply ordinary men and women more likely to get caught up in linguistic confusion by taking language beyond the context it was meant to deal with thus the task of the true philosopher i e wittgenstein was to show the fly out of the fly bottle to show that the problems with which philosophers tormented themselves were in fact not really problems at all but rather were examples of language gone on holiday as he put it so the true philosopher becomes more like a therapist removing distress and confusion than someone who creates or discusses philosophical theories or positions later work on certainty a collection of aphorisms discussing the relation between knowledge and certainty extremely influential in the philosophy of action remarks on colour

number five seven notable characteristics lanthanum is a silvery white metallic element belonging to group three of the periodic table and often considered to be one of the lanthanides found in some rare earth minerals usually in combination with cerium and other rare earth elements lanthanum is malleable ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife it is one of the most reactive of the rare earth metals the metal reacts directly with elemental carbon nitrogen boron selenium silicon phosphorus sulfur and with halogens it oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air cold water attacks lanthanum slowly while hot water attacks it much more rapidly applications uses of lanthanum carbon lighting applications especially by the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projection la two o three improves the alkali resistance of glass and is used in making special optical glasses such as infrared absorbing glass camera and telescope lenses because of the high refractive index and low dispersion of rare earth glasses small amounts of lanthanum added to steel improves its malleability resistance to impact and ductility small amounts of lanthanum added to iron helps to produce nodular cast iron small amounts of lanthanum added to molybdenum decreases the hardness of this metal and its sensitivity to temperature variations mischmetal a pyrophoric alloy used e g in lighter flints contains two five to four five lanthanum the oxide and the boride are used in electronic vacuum tubes hydrogen sponge alloys can contain lanthanum these alloys are capable of storing up to four zero zero times their own volume of hydrogen gas in a reversible adsorption process petroleum cracking catalysts gas lantern mantles glass and lapidary polishing compound la ba age dating of rocks and ores lanthanum carbonate is used medically as a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia see details below under biological role lanthanum nitrate is mainly applied in specialty glass water treatment and catalyst lanthanum hexaboride crystals are used in high brightness extended life thermionic electron emission sources for scanning electron microscopes history lanthanum was discovered in one eight three nine by swedish chemist carl gustav mosander when he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by heating and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid from the resulting solution he isolated a new rare earth he called lantana lanthanum was isolated in relatively pure form in one nine two three the word lanthanum comes from the greek lanthanein to lie hidden biological role lanthanum has no known biological role the element is not absorbed orally and when injected its elimination is very slow lanthanum carbonate was approved as a medication fosrenol shire pharmaceuticals to absorb excess phosphate in cases of end stage renal failure some rare earth chlorides such as lanthanum chloride lacl three are known to have anticoagulant properties

la with a half life of six zero zero zero zero years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than two four hours and the majority of these have half lives that are less than one minute this element also has three meta states the isotopes of lanthanum range in atomic weight from one one seven u one one seven la to one five five u one five five la precautions lanthanum has a low to moderate level of toxicity and should be handled with care in animals the injection of lanthanum solutions produces glycaemia low blood pressure degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations references los alamos national laboratory lanthanum external links webelements com lanthanum chemical elements lanthanides lutetium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol lu and atomic number seven one a metallic element of the rare earth group lutetium usually occurs in association with yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various processes a strict correlation between periodic table blocks and chemical series for neutral atoms would describe lutetium as a transition metal but it is commonly considered a lanthanide notable characteristics and applications lutetium is a silvery white corrosion resistant trivalent metal that is relatively stable in air and is the heaviest and hardest of the rare earth elements lutetium has the highest spin quantum number of the elements at seven this element is very expensive to obtain in useful quantities and therefore it has very few commercial uses however stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation hydrogenation and polymerization applications history lutetium latin lutetia meaning paris was independently discovered in one nine zero seven by french scientist georges urbain and austrian mineralogist baron carl auer von welsbach both men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia which was thought by swiss chemist jean charles galissard de marignac and most others to consist entirely of the element ytterbium the separation of lutetium from marignac s ytterbium was first described by urbain and the naming honor therefore went to him he chose the names neoytterbium new ytterbium and lutecium for the new element but neoytterbium was eventually reverted back to ytterbium and in one nine four nine the spelling of element seven one was changed to lutetium welsbach proposed the names cassiopium for element seven one after the constellation cassiopeia and albebaranium for the new name of ytterbium but these naming proposals where rejected although many german scientists still call element seven one cassiopium occurrence found with almost all other rare earth metals but never by itself lutetium is very difficult to separate from other elements and is the least abundant of all naturally occurring elements consequently it is also one of the most expensive metals costing about six times as much per gram as gold the principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite ce la etc po four which contains zero zero zero three of the element pure lutetium metal has only relatively recently been isolated and is very difficult to prepare thus it is one of the most rare and expensive of the rare earth metals it is separated from other rare earth elements by ion exchange reduction of anhydrous lucl three or luf three by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal isotopes naturally occurring lutetium is composed of one stable isotope lu one seven five nine seven four one natural abundance three three radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being lu one seven six with a half life of three seven eight one zero one zero years two five nine natural abundance lu one seven four with a half life of three three one years and lu one seven three with a half life of one three seven years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lifes that are less than nine days and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than a half an hour this element also has one eight meta states with the most stable being lu one seven seven m t one six zero four days lu one seven four m t one four two days and lu one seven eight m t two three one minutes the isotopes of lutetium range in atomic weight from one four nine nine seven three lu one five zero to one eight three nine six one lu one eight four the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope lu one seven five is electron capture with some alpha and positron emission and the primary mode after is beta emission the primary decay products before lu one seven five are element seven zero ytterbium isotopes and the

the periodic table that has the symbol lr and atomic number one zero three its most stable isotope is lr two six two with a half life of three six hours lawrencium is synthesized from californium and has no known uses notable characteristics the appearance of this element is unknown however it is most likely silvery white or gray and metallic if sufficient amounts of lawrencium were produced it would pose a radiation hazard very little is known about the chemical properties of this element but some preliminary work on a few atoms has indicated that it behaves similarly to the actinides element one zero three is a d block element analogous to lutetium and therefore is increasingly being placed with the other d block elements in the transition metal chemical series but it is still most often grouped with the actinides in the periodic table lawrencium is currently not for public sale history lawrencium was discovered by albert ghiorso torbj rn sikkeland almon larsh and robert m latimer on february one four one nine six one at the berkeley radiation laboratory now called lawrence berkeley national laboratory on the university of california berkeley campus it was produced by bombarding a three milligram target composed of three isotopes of californium with boron one zero and b one one ions in the heavy ion linear accelerator hilac the transmutation nuclei became electrically charged recoiled with a helium atmosphere and were collected on a thin copper conveyor tape this tape was then moved in order to place the collected atoms in front of a series of solid state detectors the berkeley team reported that the isotope one zero three two five seven was detected in this manner and decayed by emitting an eight six mev alpha particle with a half life of four two seconds in one nine six seven researchers in dubna russia reported that they were not able to confirm an alpha emitter with a half life of four two seconds as one zero three two five seven this assignment has since been changed to lr two five eight or lr two five nine eleven isotopes of element one zero three have been synthesized with lr two six two being the longest lived with a half life of two one six minutes it decays into nobelium two five six the isotopes of lawrencium decay via alpha emission spontaneous fission and electron capture in order of most to least common types the origin of the name preferred by the american chemical society is in reference to ernest o lawrence inventor of the cyclotron the symbol lw was originally used but in one nine six three it was changed to lr in august one nine nine seven the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac ratified the name lawrencium and symbol lr during a meeting in geneva unniltrium was sometimes used as a

english centres lead s symbol pb is an abbreviation of its latin name plumbum the english word plumbing also derives from this latin root by the mid one nine eight zero s a significant shift in lead end use patterns had taken place much of this shift was a result of the u s lead consumers compliance with environmental regulations that significantly reduced or eliminated the use of lead in nonbattery products including gasoline paints solders and water systems recently lead use is being further curtailed by the rohs directive occurrence lead ore native lead does occur in nature but it is rare currently lead is usually found in ore with zinc silver and most abundantly copper and is extracted together with these metals the main lead mineral is galena pbs which contains eight six six lead other common varieties are cerussite pbco three and anglesite pbso four but more than half of the lead used currently comes from recycling in mining the ore is extracted by drilling or blasting and then crushed and ground the ore is then treated using extractive metallurgy the froth flotation process separates the lead and other minerals from the waste rock tailings to form a concentrate the concentrate which can range from five zero to six zero lead is dried and then treated using pyrometallurgy the concentrate is sintered before being smelted in to produce a nine seven lead concentrate the lead is then cooled in stages which causes the lighter impurites dross to rise to the surface where they can be removed the molten lead bullion is then refined by additional smelting with air

plateau tennessee limestone is a sedimentary rock composed largely of the mineral calcite calcium carbonate caco three limestones often contain variable amounts of silica in the form of chert or flint as well as varying amounts of clay silt and sand as disseminations nodules or layers within the rock the primary source of the calcite in limestone is most commonly marine organisms these organisms secrete shells that settle out of the water column and are deposited on ocean floors as pelagic ooze see lysocline for information on calcite dissolution secondary calcite may also be deposited by supersaturated meteoric waters groundwater that precipitates the material in caves this produces speleothems such as stalagmites and stalactites another form taken by calcite is that of oolites oolitic limestone which can be recognised by its granular appearance limestone makes up about one zero percent of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks pure limestones are white or almost white because of impurities such as clay sand organic remains iron oxide and other materials many limestones exhibit different colors especially on weathered surfaces limestone may be crystalline clastic granular or massive depending on the method of formation crystals of calcite quartz dolomite or barite may line small cavities in the rock folk and durham classifications are used to describe limestones more precisely travertine is a banded compact variety of limestone formed along streams particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs calcium carbonate is deposited

is a distinct rainy season from may to november followed by a dry season from december to april the capital and largest city of laos is vientiane and other major cities include luang prabang savannakhet and pakse in one nine nine three the government set aside two one of the nation s land area as national biodiversity conservation areas nbca which may be developed into a national park system if completed it is expected to be the most comprehensive and one of the finest national park systems in southeast asia a number of animal species have been discovered or re discovered in laos in recent years these include the striped or annamite rabbit the saola and most recently the laotian rock rat or kha nyou economy the government of laos one of the few remaining official communist states began decentralising control and encouraging private enterprise in one nine eight six the results starting from an extremely low base were striking growth averaged six in one nine eight eight

most growth the economies of vientiane luang prabang and savannakhet in particular have experienced significant booms in recent years pakxe has also experienced growth much of the country however lacks adequate infrastructure laos has no railways although a short link is planned to connect vientiane with thailand over the thai lao friendship bridge the major roads connecting the major urban centers mainly forming route one three have been significantly upgraded in recent years but villages that are far from major roads are accessible only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year round there is limited external and internal telecommunication particularly of the wireline sort but cell phone usage has become widespread in urban centers in many rural areas electricity is either not available or only during scheduled periods subsistence agriculture still accounts for half of gdp and provides eight zero of total employment the economy receives aid from the imf and other international sources and from new foreign investment in food processing and mining most notably of copper and gold tourism is the fastest growing industry in the country however economic development in general is hampered by a serious case of brain drain a two zero zero five world bank study reported that three seven of educated laotians lived abroad putting the country in five th place for worst brain drain in late two zero zero four laos gained normal trade relations status with the us allowing laos based producers to face lower tariffs on their exports this may help spur growth tourism in

predominate some vietnamese and chinese minorities remain particularly in the towns but many left in two waves after independence in the late one nine four zero s and again after one nine seven five the term laotian does not necessarily refer to the ethnic lao language ethnic lao people language or customs but is a political term that also includes the non ethnic lao groups within laos and identifies them as laotian because of their political citizenship in a similar vein the word lao can also describe the people cuisine language and culture of the people of northeast thailand isan who are ethnic lao the predominant religion is theravada buddhism which along with the common animism practiced among the mountain tribes coexists peacefully with spirit worship there also is a small

one three five three his successors especially king photisarath in the one six th century helped establish theravada buddhism as the predominant religion of the country in the one seven th century lan xang entered a period of decline and the late one eight th century siam now thailand established control over much of what is now laos the region was divided into three dependent states centered on luang prabang in the north vientiane in the center and champassak in the south the vientiane lao rebelled in one eight two eight but were defeated and the area incorporated into siam following its occupation of vietnam france absorbed laos into french indochina via treaties with siam in one eight nine three and one nine zero four during world war ii the japanese occupied french indochina when japan surrendered lao nationalists declared laos independent but by early one nine four six french troops had reoccupied the country and conferred limited autonomy on laos during the first indochina war the indochinese communist party formed the pathet lao resistance organization committed to lao independence laos gained full independence following the french defeat by the vietnamese communists and the subsequent geneva peace conference in one nine five four elections were held in one nine five five and the first coalition government led by prince souvanna phouma was formed in one nine five seven the coalition government collapsed in one nine five eight under pressure from the united states in one nine six zero elements of the army staged a coup and demanded reformation of a neutralist government the second coalition government once again led by souvanna phouma was not successful in holding power rightist forces under general phoumi nosavan drove out the neutralist government from power later that same year a second geneva conference held in one nine six one six two provided for the independence and neutrality of laos but the agreement was subverted by both the united states and north vietnam and the war soon resumed growing american and north vietnamese military presence in the country increasingly drew laos into the second indochina war one nine five four one nine seven five for nearly a decade laos was subjected to the heaviest bombing in the history of warfare as the u s sought to destroy the ho chi minh trail that passed through eastern laos shortly after the paris peace accords led to the withdrawal of u s forces from viet nam a ceasefire between the pathet lao and the government led to a new coalition government nonetheless the political struggle continued and after the fall of south vietnam to communist forces in april one nine seven five the pathet lao was able to take power from the demoralised rightists with little resistance on december two one nine seven five the king abdicated his throne and the lao people s democratic republic was established the new communist government led by kaysone phomvihane imposed centralized economic decision making and incarcerated many members of the previous government and military in re education camps these policies prompted about one zero precent of the lao population to leave the country laos depended heavily on soviet aid up until the soviet collapse in one nine nine one in the one nine nine zero s the communist party gave up centralised management of the economy but still has a monopoly of political power history of laos image la map png detailed map of laos laos is a landlocked nation in southeast asia northeast of thailand west of vietnam that covers two three six eight zero zero square kilometers in the center of the southeast asian peninsula is surrounded by burma cambodia china thailand and vietnam its location has often made it a buffer between more powerful neighboring states as well as a crossroads for trade and communication migration and international conflict have contributed to the present ethnic composition of the country and to the geographic distribution of its ethnic groups geographic coordinates topography most of the western border of laos is demarcated by the mekong river which is an important artery for transportation the khong falls at the southern end of the country prevent access to the sea but cargo boats travel along the entire length of the mekong in laos during most of the year smaller power boats and pirogues provide an important means of transportation on many of the tributaries of the mekong the mekong has thus not been an obstacle but a facilitator for communication and the similarities between laos and northeast thai society same people same language reflect the close contact that has existed across the river for centuries also many laotians living in the mekong valley have relatives and friends in thailand prior to the twentieth century laotian kingdoms and principalities encompassed areas on both sides of the mekong and thai control in the late nineteenth century extended to the left bank although the mekong was established as a border by french colonial forces travel from one side to the other has been significantly limited only since the establishment of the lao people s democratic republic lpdr or laos in one nine seven five the eastern border with vietnam extends for two one three zero kilometers mostly along the crest of the annamite chain and serves as a physical barrier between the chinese influenced culture of vietnam and the indianized states of laos and thailand these mountains are sparsely populated by tribal minorities who traditionally have not acknowledged the border with vietnam any more than lowland lao have been constrained by the one seven five four kilometer mekong river border with thailand thus ethnic minority populations are found on both the laotian and vietnamese sides of the frontier because of their relative isolation contact between these groups and lowland lao has been mostly confined to trading laos shares its short only five four one kilometers southern border with cambodia and ancient khmer ruins at wat pho and other southern locations attest to the long history of contact between the lao and the khmer in the north the country is bounded by a mountainous four two three kilometer border with china and shares the two three five kilometer long mekong river border with burma the topography of laos is largely mountainous with elevations above five zero zero meters typically characterized by steep terrain narrow river valleys and low agricultural potential this mountainous landscape extends across most of the north of the country except for the plain of vientiane and the plain of jars in xiangkhoang province the southern panhandle of the country contains large level areas in savannakh t and champasak provinces that are well suited for extensive paddy rice cultivation and livestock raising much of khammouan province and the eastern part of all the southern provinces are mountainous together the alluvial plains and terraces of the mekong and its tributaries cover only about two zero of the land area only about four of the total land area is classified as arable the forested land area has declined significantly

image and mimics the country s border with laos and cambodia speaks of the massive deforestation that occurs in this region one of southeastern asia s prominent environmental concerns deforestation has played a major role in flooding in the region laos has a tropical monsoon climate with a pronounced rainy season from may through october a cool dry season from november through february and a hot dry season in march and april generally monsoons occur at the same time across the country although that time may vary significantly from one year to the next rainfall also varies regionally with the highest amounts three seven zero zero millimeters annually recorded on the bolovens plateau in champasak province city rainfall stations have recorded that savannakh t averages one four four zero millimeters of rain annually vientiane receives about one seven zero zero millimeters and louangphrabang luang prabang receives about one three six zero millimeters rainfall is not always adequate for rice cultivation however and the relatively high average precipitation conceals years where rainfall may be only half or less of the norm causing significant declines in rice yields such droughts often are regional leaving production in other parts of the country unaffected temperatures range from highs around four zero c along the mekong in march and april to lows of five c or less in the uplands of xiangkhoang and ph ngsali in january transportation routes because of its mountainous topography and lack of development laos has few reliable transportation routes this inaccessibility has historically limited the ability of any government to maintain a presence in areas distant from the national or provincial capitals and has limited interchange and communication among villages and ethnic groups the mekong and nam ou are the only natural channels suitable for large draft boat transportation and from december through may low water limits the size of the craft that may be used over many routes laotians in lowland villages located on the banks of smaller rivers have traditionally traveled in pirogues for fishing trading and visiting up and down the river for limited distances otherwise travel is by ox cart over level terrain or by foot the steep mountains and lack of roads have caused upland ethnic groups to rely entirely on pack baskets and horse packing for transportation natural resources the road system is not extensive however a rudimentary network begun under french colonial rule and continued from the one nine five zero s has provided an important means of increased intervillage communication movement of market goods and a focus for new settlements in mid one nine nine four travel in most areas was difficult and expensive and most laotians traveled only limited distances if at all as a result of ongoing improvements in the road system during the early one nine nine zero s however it is expected that in the future villagers will more easily be able to seek medical care send children to schools at district centers and work outside the village clear cut hillside along the mekong river expanding commercial exploitation of forests plans for additional hydroelectric facilities foreign demands for wild animals and nonwood forest products for food and traditional medicines and a growing population have brought new and increasing attention to the forests traditionally forests have been important sources of wild foods herbal medicines and timber for house construction even into the one nine nine zero s the government viewed the forest as a valued reserve of natural products for noncommercial household consumption government efforts to preserve valuable hardwoods for commercial extraction have led to measures to prohibit swidden cultivation throughout the country further government restrictions on clearing forestland for swidden cropping in the late one nine eight zero s along with attempts to gradually resettle upland swidden farming villages ban to lowland locations suitable for paddy rice cultivation had significant effects on upland villages traditionally villages rely on forest products as a food reserve during years of poor rice harvest and as a regular source of fruits and vegetables by the one nine nine zero s however these gathering systems were breaking down in many areas at the same time

baltic forefathers of the latvian people have lived on the eastern coast of the baltic sea since the third millennium bc at the beginning of this era the territory known today as latvia became famous as a trading crossroads the famous route from the vikings to the greeks mentioned in ancient chronicles stretched from scandinavia through latvian territory via the river daugava to the ancient russia and byzantine empire the ancient balts of this time actively participated in the trading network across the european continent latvia s coast was known as a place for obtaining amber up to and into the middle ages amber was more valuable than gold in many places latvian amber was known in places as far away as ancient greece and the roman empire in the nine zero zero s a d the ancient balts started to form specific tribal realms gradually four individual baltic tribal cultures developed couronians latgallians selonians semigallians in latvian kur i latga i s i and zemga i the largest of them was the latgallian tribe which was the most advanced in its socio political development in the one one zero zero s and one two zero zero s the couronians maintained a lifestyle of intensive invasions that included looting and pillaging on the west coast of the baltic sea they became known as the baltic vikings but the selonians and semgallians during this time were known as peace loving and prosperous farmers german period because of its strategic geographic location latvian territory has always been invaded by other larger nations and this situation has defined the fate of latvia and its people at the end of the one one zero zero s latvia was more often visited by traders from western europe who set out on trading journeys along latvia s longest river the daugava to russia at the very end of the one two th century german traders arrived and with them came preachers of the christian faith who attempted to convert the pagan baltic and finno ugrian tribes to the christian faith the balts did not willingly convert to the new and different beliefs and practices and particularly opposed the ritual of christening news of this reached the pope in rome and it was decided that crusaders would be sent into latvia to influence the situation the germans founded riga in one two zero one and gradually it became the largest and most beautiful city in the southern part of the baltic sea with the arrival of the german crusaders the development of separate tribal realms of ancient latvias came to an end in the one two zero zero s a confederation of feudal nations developed under german rule that was called livonia livonia included today s latvia and estonia in one two eight two r ga and later c sis limba i koknese and valmiera were included in the northern german trading organisation or the hanseatic league hansa from this time riga became an important point in west east trading r ga being the centre of the eastern baltic region formed close cultural contacts with western europe polish and swedish period outline of the polish lithuanian commonwealth with its major subdivisions as of one six one nine superimposed on present day national borders the one five zero zero s were a time of great changes for the inhabitants of latvia notable for the reformation and the collapse of the livonian nation after the livonian war one five five eight one five eight three today s latvian territory came under polish lithuanian rule the lutheran faith was accepted in kurzeme zemgale and vidzeme but the roman catholic faith maintained its dominance in latgale it remains so to this day in the one six zero zero s the duchy of courland once a part of livonia experienced a notable economic boom it established two colonies an island in the estuary of the gambia river in africa and tobago island in the caribbean sea names from this period still survive today in these places however after the polish swedish war one six zero zero one six two nine r ga came under swedish rule in one six two one it became the largest and most developed swedish city during this time vidzeme was known as the swedish bread basket because it supplied the larger part of the swedish kingdom with wheat the rest of latvia stayed polish until the second partion of poland in one seven nine three when it became russian consolidation of the latvian nation occurred in the one

vidzeme through vidzeme to riga russia obtained a clear passage to europe by the end of the one eight th century due to the polish partitions all of latvia s territory was under russian rule serfdom was abolished in courland in one eight one eight and vidzeme in one eight one nine in one eight four nine a law granted a legal basis for the creation of peasant owned farms reforms were slower in latgale where serfdom was only abolished in one eight six one industry developed quickly and the number of the inhabitants grew latvia became one of russia s most developed provinces in the one nine th century the first latvian national awakening began among ethnic latvian intellectuals a movement that partly reflected similar nationalist trends elsewhere in europe this revival was led by the young latvians in latvian jaunlatvie i from the one eight five zero s to the one eight eight zero s primarily a literary and cultural movement with significant political implications the young latvians soon came into severe conflict with the baltic germans with increasing pauperization in rural areas and growing urbanization a loose but broad leftist movement called the new current arose in the late one eight eight zero s led by rainis and p teris stu ka editors of the newspaper dienas lapa this movement was soon influenced by marxism and led to the creation of the latvian social democratic labour party latvia in the two zero th century saw an explosion of popular discontent in the one nine zero five revolution independence the idea of an independent latvia became a reality at the beginning of the one nine zero zero s the course of world war i wwi activated the idea of independence wwi directly involved latvians and latvian territory courageous latvian riflemen latvie u str

period latvia was forced to adopt soviet farming methods and the economic infrastructure developed in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s was purposely destroyed rural areas were forced into collectivisation because latvia had still maintained a well developed infrastructure and educated specialists it was decided in moscow that some of the soviet union s most advanced manufacturing factories were to be based in latvia new industry was created in latvia including a major machinery factory raf and electrotechnical factories as well as some food and oil processing plants however there was not enough workforce to run the newly built factories in order to run these factories russian workers were flooded into the country noticeably decreasing the proportion of ethnic latvians by the end of the one nine eight zero s the ethnic latvians comprised only about five zero of the population one three eight seven seven five seven however before wwii they comprised around eight zero

estonia and lithuania about nine eight of the country lie under two zero zero m elevation six four zero ft the damp climate resembles new england s with the exception of the coastal plains the ice age divided latvia into three main regions the morainic western and eastern uplands and the middle lowlands latvia holds over one two zero zero zero rivers only one seven of which are longer than six zero miles and over three zero zero zero small lakes most of which are eutrophic the major rivers include daugava lielupe gauja also salaca woodlands more than half of which are pine woods cover around four one of the country other than peat dolomite and limestone natural resources are scarce latvia has five three one km three two nine mi of sandy coastline and the ports of liepaja and ventspils provide important warm water harbors for the baltic littoral latvia is slightly larger than denmark estonia the netherlands or switzerland its strategic location has instigated many wars between rival powers on its territory as recently as one nine four four the u s s r granted russia the abrene region on the livonian frontier which latvia still contests geographic coordinates physical environment latvia is traditionally seen as a tiny country in terms of its population of about two six million it deserves this designation geographically however latvia encompasses six four five eight nine square kilometers a size surpassing that of better known european states such as belgium the netherlands switzerland and denmark seen from the air latvia is an extension of the east european plain its flat terrain differs little from that of its surrounding neighbors latvia s only distinct border is the baltic sea coast which extends for five three one kilometers its neighbors include estonia on the north two six seven kilometers of common border lithuania on the south four five three kilometers belarus on the southeast one four one kilometers and russia on the east two one seven kilometers prior to world war ii latvia bordered eastern poland but as a result of boundary changes by the soviet union this territory was attached to belorussia also in one nine four four russia annexed the northeastern border district of latvia known as abrene including the town of pytalovo geographic features the physiography of latvia and its neighboring areas was formed to a large degree during the quartenary period and the pleistocene ice age when soil and debris were pushed by glaciers into mounds and hills undulating plains cover seven five of latvia s territory and provide the main areas for farming two five of the territory lies in uplands of moderate sized hills about two seven of the total territory is cultivable with the central zemgale plain south of riga being the most fertile and profitable the three main upland areas in the provinces of kurzeme western latvia vidzeme central latvia and latgale eastern latvia provide a picturesque pattern of fields interspersed with forests and numerous lakes and rivers in this area the extensive glacial moraines eskers and drumlins have limited the profitability of agriculture by fragmenting fields and presenting serious erosion problems about one zero of latvian territory consists of peat bogs swamps and marshes some of which are covered by stunted forest growth forests are the outstanding feature of latvia claiming four two of the territory timber and wood products are among the country s most important exports two thirds of the forests consist of scots pine or norway spruce latvian forests differ from those of north america primarily because of their relatively brush free understory the forest floor however is far from a biological desert as is often the case in tree plantations indeed one of the most widespread pastimes of the population is picking bilberries cranberries mushrooms and other bounties of the natural environment few of the forests are fully mature because of previous overcutting and also because of several violent storms during the one nine six zero s which snapped or uprooted millions of trees as a consequence most of the wood today is derived from thinning and improvement cuts forming five zero of the annual total growth increment of eight million cubic meters of wood for a long time wood has been a basic source of energy the utilization of wood as fuel has increased dramatically in the one nine nine zero s even in cities because of the numbing price hikes on other forms of energy local wood is also an important resource for the pulp and paper industry and for specialized plywood and furniture manufacturers a great concern today is the unregulated cutting of timber for the foreign market prices paid by european wood buyers are phenomenally high by local standards and there is much pressure to utilize this opportunity for cash accumulation even without legal permits by one nine nine two the problem had become so serious that latvian forestry officials were given the right to carry firearms not all forests are productive many areas especially abandoned formerly private farms have become overgrown with low value alders and other scrub trees with the return of private farming these areas are once again being reclaimed for agriculture in the process however there is a danger that these areas which are ideal for wildlife will become threatened the decades long neglect of extensive areas of marginal farmland was a boon for the establishment of unique ecological conditions favorable for the survival of animal species rarely found in other parts of europe according to a world wildlife fund study in one nine nine two latvia has unusual populations of black storks lesser spotted eagles otters beaver lynx and wolves there are also great concentrations of deer eight six zero zero zero red deer and roe deer wild boar three two zero zero zero elk two five zero zero zero and red fox one three zero zero zero many latvians today are planning to exploit this resource by catering to foreign hunters the variegated and rapidly changing physiography of glacial moraines and lowlands has also allowed temperate flora such as oaks to grow within a few hundred meters of northern flora such as bog cotton and cloudberries this variety and the rapid change in natural ecosystems are among the unique features of the republic the soviet system left behind another windfall for naturalists the latvian western seacoast was a carefully guarded border region almost all houses near the sea were razed or evacuated as a result about three zero zero kilometers of undeveloped seashore are graced only by forests of pine and spruce and ecologically unique sand dunes the temptation for fast profit however may foster violation of laws that clearly forbid any construction within one kilometer of the sea unless the government takes vigorous action one of the last remaining wild shorelines in europe may become just a memory the seashore adjoining the population centers around riga was a major focus of tourism during the soviet era jurmala with its many sanatoriums and tourist accommodations its tall pines sandy beaches and antique architecture is now experiencing a wrenching readjustment east european tourists can no longer afford to come here and western tourists have not yet discovered the area and its relatively low prices west europeans may be loath to come however because excessive pollution has closed jurmala beaches to swimming since one nine eight eight moreover facilities and accommodations adequate for soviet tastes fall far short of minimal standards expected in the west latvia has an abundant network of rivers contributing to the visual beauty and the economy of the country the largest river is the daugava which has been an important route for several thousand years it has been used by local tribes as well as by vikings russians and other europeans for trade war and conquest with a total length of one zero two zero kilometers the daugava or zapadnaya dvina in its upper reaches originates in the valday hills in russia s tver oblast meanders through northern belarus and then winds through latvia for three seven zero kilometers before emptying into the gulf of riga it is about two zero zero meters wide when it enters latvia increasing to between six five zero and seven five zero meters at riga and to one five kilometers at its mouth the river carries an average annual flow of two one cubic kilometers its total descent within latvia of ninety eight meters has made it an attractive source of hydroelectric power production the first hydroelectric station at kegums was built during latvia s independence period the second dam at plavinas aroused an unusual wave of protest in one nine five eight most latvians opposed the flooding of historical sites and a particularly scenic gorge with rare plants and natural features such as the staburags a cliff comparable in cultural significance to the lorelei in germany the construction of the dam was endorsed in one nine five nine however after the purge of relatively liberal and nationally oriented leaders under berklavs and their replacement by moscow oriented ideologically conservative cadres led by pelse the third dam just above riga did not provoke much protest because of the seeming hopelessness of the cause the proposed fourth dam at the town of daugavpils on the daugava river became the rallying point for protest in one nine eight six eight seven by hundreds of thousands of latvians this dam was not constructed in spite of the vast expenditures already poured into the project smaller rivers include the lielupe in central latvia with an average annual flow of three six cubic kilometers the venta in the west with two nine cubic kilometers the gauja in the northeast with two five cubic kilometers and the aiviekste in the east with two one cubic kilometers very little hydroelectric power is generated by their waters although planners are now thinking of reactivating some of the abandoned older dams and turbines the gauja is one of latvia s most attractive relatively clean rivers and has an adjoining large national park along both of its banks as one of its notable features its cold waters attract trout and salmon and its sandstone cliff and forest setting are increasingly a magnet for tourists interested in the environment more than six zero of the annual water volume of latvia s six largest rivers comes from neighboring countries mainly from belarus and lithuania these adjoining resources create obvious needs for cooperation especially in pollution control the dangers from a lack of cooperation were brought home to latvians in november one nine nine zero when a polymer complex in navapolatsk belarus accidentally spilled one two eight tons of cyanide derivatives into the daugava river with no warning to downstream users in latvia only the presence of numerous dead fish alerted latvian inhabitants to the danger climate latvia s northern location matches labrador s latitude in the summer daylight hours are long and in the winter short in december it is still pitch dark at nine zero zero a m and daylight disappears before four zero zero p m this light deprivation may be an important ingredient in deciphering certain aspects of latvian collective behavior it may account for the general exuberance and joie de vivre in spring and summer and the relative taciturnity and melancholy the rest of the year the climate is far different from that of labrador however because of the effect of the gulf stream flowing across the atlantic ocean from mexico average temperatures in winter are reasonably mild ranging in january from two eight c in liepaja on the western coast to six six c in the southeastern town of daugavpils july temperatures range from one six seven c in liepaja to one seven six c in daugavpils latvia s proximity to the sea brings high levels of humidity and precipitation with average annual precipitation of five six six millimeters in riga there an average of one eight zero days per year have precipitation forty four days have fog and only seventy two days are sunny continuous snow cover lasts eighty two days and the frost free period lasts one seven seven days this precipitation has helped provide the abundant water for latvia s many rivers and lakes but it has created many problems as well a large part of agricultural land requires drainage much money has been spent for amelioration projects involving the installation of drainage pipes the straightening and deepening of natural streams the digging of drainage ditches and the construction of polder dams during the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s drainage work absorbed about one third of all agricultural investments in latvia although accounting for only one third of one of the territory latvia was responsible for one one of all artificially drained land in the former soviet union an additional problem associated with precipitation is the difficulty of early mechanized sowing and harvesting because of waterlogged fields heavy precipitation occurs especially during harvest time in august and september requiring heavy investment outlays in grain drying structures and ventilation systems in one nine nine two ironically latvia experienced the driest summer in recorded weather history but unusually heavy rains in the preceding spring kept crop damage below the extent expected the moist climate has been a major factor orienting latvian agriculture toward animal husbandry and dairying even most of the field crops such as barley oats and potatoes are grown for animal feed natural resources latvia cannot claim valuable natural resources nevertheless the abundant presence of such materials as limestone for cement six billion cubic meters gypsum one six five million cubic meters high quality clay three seven five million cubic meters dolomite six one five million cubic meters peat four eight zero million tons and construction materials including gravel and sand satisfy local needs fish from the baltic sea is another potential export resource export amber million year old chunks of petrified pine pitch is often found on the beaches of the baltic sea and is in high demand for jewelry it has also had a symbolic impact on the country which is often called dzimtarzeme or amberland the future may hold potentially more valuable resources if oil fields are discovered in latvian territorial waters as some

two zero zero three gdp growth was seven five and inflation was two nine unemployment was eight eight in two zero zero three almost unchanged compared to the previous two years privatization is mostly complete except for some of the large state owned utilities it is expected that gdp growth will remain high in two zero zero four while inflation is expected to increase on may one two zero zero four latvia joined the european union economic history for centuries under hanseatic and german influence and then during its inter war independence latvia used its geographic location as an important east west commercial and trading center industry served local markets while timber paper and agricultural products supplied latvia s main exports conversely the years of russian and soviet occupation tended to integrate latvia s economy to serve those empires large internal industrial needs comprising four zero one of the populace non ethnic latvians control almost eight zero of the economy since reestablishing its independence latvia has proceeded with market oriented reforms albeit at a measured pace its freely traded currency the lat was introduced in one nine nine three and has held steady or appreciated against major world currencies inflation was reduced from nine five eight six in one nine nine two to two five by one nine nine five and one four by two zero zero two it has stayed low since then but has increased to seven one in two zero zero five after contracting substantially between one nine nine one nine three the economy steadied in late one nine nine four led by recovery in light industry and a boom in commerce and finance this recovery was interrupted twice first by a banking crisis and the bankruptcy of banka baltija latvia s largest bank in one nine nine five and second by a severe crisis in the financial system of neighbouring russia in one nine nine eight since two zero zero zero latvian gdp has grown by six eight a year for four consecutive years latvia s state budget was balanced in one nine nine seven but the russian financial crisis of one nine nine eight resulted in large deficits which are being slowly reduced from four of gdp in one nine nine nine to one eight in two zero zero three these deficits are however smaller than in most of the other countries joining the european union in two zero zero four replacement of the centrally planned system imposed during the soviet period with a structure based on free market principles has been occurring spontaneously from below much more than through consistently applied structural adjustment official statistics tend to understate the booming private sector suggesting that the latvian people and their economy are doing much better than is reflected statistically two thirds of employment and six zero of gdp is now in the private sector recovery in light industry and riga s emergence as a regional financial and commercial center have offset shrinkage of the state owned industrial sector and agriculture the official unemployment figure has held steady in the seven one zero range privatisation privatisation in latvia is almost complete virtually all of the previously state owned small and medium companies have been successfully privatized leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies in particular the country s main energy company latvenergo remains state owned and there is no plans to privatize it government also holds minority shares in ventspils nafta oil transit company and country s main telecom company lattelekom but it plans to sell those despite a bad image based on loosely controlled privatization efforts in the early days as well as the difficulties of privatizing the utilities latvian privatization efforts have led to the development of a dynamic and prosperous private sector which accounted for nearly six eight of gdp in two zero zero zero foreign investment in latvia is still modest compared with the levels in

relations by country government of latvia the republic of lebanon or lebanon is a small largely mountainous country in the middle east located at the eastern edge of the mediterranean sea it is bordered by syria to the north and east and israel to the south with a narrow coastline along its western edge the flag of lebanon features the lebanon cedar in green against a white backdrop with two quarter height horizontal red stripes on the top and bottom the name lebanon also loubnan or lebnan is derived from the aramaic word laban meaning white a reference to snow capped mount lebanon history lebanon is one of the main regions of the phoenicians semitic traders whose maritime culture flourished for more than two zero zero zero years roughly from two seven zero zero to five zero zero bc phoenicia was an ancient civilization in the north of ancient canaan with its heartland along the coastal plains of what are now lebanon and syria phoenician civilization was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread right across the mediterranean during the first millennium bc though ancient boundaries of such city centered cultures fluctuated the city of tyre seems to have been the southernmost sarepta between sidon and tyre is the most thoroughly excavated city of the phoenician homeland although the people of the region called themselves the canaani or kenaani the name phoenicia became common thanks to the greeks who called them the phoiniki phoin k see also list of traditional greek place names the greek word for phoenician was synonymous with the colour purple red or crimson phoinix through its close association with the famous dye tyrian purple cf also phoenix the dye was used in ancient textile trade and highly desired the phoenicians became known as the purple people the phoenicians most likely a semitic people spoke the phoenician language later called punic since the roman word for purple was puniceus in addition to their many inscriptions the phoenicians contrary to some reports wrote many books that have not survived evangelical preparation by eusebius of caesarea quotes extensively from philo of byblos and sanchuniathon furthermore the phoenician punic colonies of north africa continued to be a source of knowledge about the phoenicians saint augustine knew at least a smattering of punic and occasionally uses it to explain cognate words found in hebrew the name of his mother saint monica is said to be of punic origin as well the region was a territory of the roman empire in the province of syria and during the middle ages was important in the crusades it was then taken by the ottoman empire following the collapse of the ottoman empire after world war i the league of nations mandated the five provinces that make up present day lebanon to france modern lebanon s constitution drawn up in one nine two six specified a balance of political power among the major religious groups the country gained independence in one nine four three and french troops withdrew in one nine four six as is common with artificial states lebanon s history from independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil including a leadership crisis in one nine five eight marked by the intervention of us marines interspersed with prosperity built on beirut s position as a regional center for finance and trade civil war one nine seven five one nine nine zero until the outbreak of the lebanese civil war beirut the capital of lebanon was noted for its wide boulevards french style architecture and modernity and was called the paris of the middle east lebanon as a whole was known as the switzerland of the middle east swisra ash shark enjoying a similar conflict free status as costa rica in central america and until recently uruguay in south america beginning of the war after the one nine four eight arab israeli conflict lebanon became home to more than one one zero zero zero zero palestinian refugees who had fled from israel more palestinian refugees arrived after the one nine six seven arab israeli war and black september by one nine seven five they numbered more than three zero zero zero zero zero with yassir arafat s palestine liberation organization plo in charge of their political and military activities during the early one nine seven zero s difficulties arose over the increase of palestinian refugees in the south initially the fighting began between these palestinians referred to as anti lebanese militias by some and the indigenous lebanese leftists the communists and socialist parties as the fighting intensified the sides involved became more distinct on one side were a number of mostly christian maronite militias the most important of which was linked to the phalangist party its commander was bachir gemayel the other side comprised a coalition of palestinians refugees sunni muslim and druze forces the civil war left the nation with no effective central government syrian intervention and occupation map of lebanon in june one nine seven six syria sent four zero zero zero zero troops into lebanon to prevent the maronite militias from being overrun by palestinian forces the fact that baathist syrians were fighting against palestinians was ironic together the syrians and maronites pushed the palestinians out of beirut and into southern lebanon over the next few years shifting political climates resulted in syria being allied with the palestinians and the maronites allied with israel syrian forces remained in lebanon effectively dominating its government into the first years of the two one st century first israeli invasion and occupation cross border attacks by palestinian groups in southern lebanon against civilians in israeli territory led to an invasion by the israeli defense forces idf on march one five one nine seven eight in what was titled the litani river operation a few days later the united nations security council passed resolutions four two five and four two six calling for the withdrawal of israeli forces and establishing an international peace keeping force in southern lebanon the united nations interim force in lebanon unifil three months later on june one three one nine seven eight israel completed the withdrawal of its troops and turned over control of southern lebanon to the christian sla a militia allied with israel second israeli invasion and occupation the plo s armed forces continued to use lebanon as a base to attack israel with rockets and artillery and on june six one nine eight two israel again invaded lebanon with the objective of evicting the plo israeli forces occupied areas from the southern lebanese border with israel northward into areas of beirut during this invasion the phalangist militia under the command of elie hobeika moved into the sabra and shatila refugee camps with the knowledge of israeli defense minister ariel sharon and committed the first sabra and shatila massacre israel s plans for lebanon suffered a severe setback on september one four one nine eight two with the assassination of the phalangist leader and president elect bachir gemayel who had rallied all of the lebanese and most of the political parties around him and a unified lebanon who was regarded as secretly sympathetic to israel to date there is no formal declaration of war between lebanon and israel despite the lack of communication between the two nations international mediation a multinational force landed in beirut on august two zero one nine eight two to oversee the plo withdrawal from lebanon and us mediation resulted in the evacuation of syrian troops and plo fighters from beirut this period saw the rise of radicalism among the country s factions and a number of landmark terrorist attacks against american forces including the destruction of the us embassy by a truck bomb and an even deadlier attack on the us marines barracks concurrently in one nine eight two hezbollah was created by former members of amal and other religious clerics one nine eight eight and one nine eight nine saw unprecedented chaos the parliament failed to elect a successor to president amine gemayel who had replaced his slain brother bachir in one nine eight two whose term expired on two three september fifteen minutes before his term expired gemayel appointed an interim administration headed by the army commander general michel aoun his predecessor selim al hoss refused to accept his dismissal in aoun s favour lebanon was thus left with no president and two rival governments that feuded for power and more than four zero private militias end of the war the one nine eight nine arab league sponsored taif agreement marked the beginning of the end of the war it is estimated that more than one zero zero zero zero zero were killed and one zero zero zero zero zero maimed during the one five year war on may two two two zero zero zero israel unilaterally completed its withdrawal from the south of lebanon in accordance with un security council resolution four two five of one nine seven eight on september two two zero zero four the

april two zero zero five see cedar revolution below and iran exercises heavy influence over hezbollah forces in the beqaa valley and southern lebanon nevertheless areas of lebanon and beirut in particular are moving toward a sense of normality and stability lebanese civil society enjoys significantly more freedoms than elsewhere in the arab world after twelve years the reconstruction of downtown beirut is largely complete lebanon s telcommunication rehabilitation is well underway and in two zero zero four and two zero zero five foreign investment in the country topped one billion solidere has also announced many projects that will be complete in two zero zero seven qana shelling on april one eight one nine nine six in the midst of operation grapes of wrath and following hezbollah rocket attacks israeli forces shelled a unifil compound in qana where eight zero zero lebanese civilians had taken refuge resulting in more than one zero zero lebanese dead and approximately three zero zero wounded including four unifil soldiers israel declared the shelling a tragic accident while a un inquiry shortly thereafter challenged those claims an informal cease fire understanding was reached eight days later cedar revolution intifada of independence note although international media prefer the term cedar revolution the lebanese people refer to these events as the intifada uprising of independence hariri assassination rafik hariri one nine four four two zero zero five on february one four two zero zero five after one zero years of relative political stability lebanon was shaken by the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri in a car bomb explosion it is widely believed that syria was responsible for the attack due to its extensive military and intelligence presence in lebanon and to the public rift between hariri and damascus over the syrian backed constitutional amendment extending pro syrian president lahoud s term in office syria however denies any involvement some sources also suggest a cover up of criminal evidence by lebanese authorities up to this point no person or party has been directly accused of the murder though investigations continue demonstrations the assassination resulted in huge anti syrian protests by lebanese citizens in beirut demanding the resignation of the pro syrian government following the examples of the rose revolution and orange revolution in two zero zero four the popular action was dubbed the cedar revolution by the us state department a name which quickly caught on among the international media on february two eight two zero zero five as over seven zero zero zero zero people demonstrated in martyrs square prime minister omar karami and his cabinet resigned they remained in office temporarily in a caretaker role prior to the appointment of replacements as outlined by the constitution in response hezbollah organized a large counter demonstration staged on march eight in beirut supporting syria and accusing israel and the united states of meddling in internal lebanese affairs hezbollah is a secondary target of resolution one five five nine which demands all lebanese militias be disarmed it has since been trying to rally masses to protest against foreign intervention this demonstration was much larger than earlier anti syrian protests journalists estimated the crowds to number in the hundreds of thousands while an unnamed official and the television station run by the pro syrian amal party gave an estimate of one five million on march one four one month after hariri s assassination throngs of people rallied in martyrs square in the largest gathering ever in lebanon wire services estimated the crowds at eight zero zero zero zero zero while police officials put the number close to one million protestors of all sects even including a number of shiites marched demanding the truth about hariri s murder and independence from syrian occupation the march reiterated their will for a sovereign democratic and unified country free of syria s hegemony in the weeks following the demonstrations bombs were detonated in christian areas near beirut although the damage was mostly material these acts demonstrate the danger of lebanon relapsing into sectarian strife parliamentary elections after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations to form a new government prime minister omar karami resigned the post for the third time in his political career on one three april two zero zero five two days later najib mikati a us educated millionaire businessman and former minister of transportation and public works was appointed prime minister designate a moderate pro syrian mikati secured the post through the support of the opposition which had previously boycotted such negotiations during the first parliamentary elections held after syria s withdrawal from lebanon in may two zero zero five the anti syrian coalition of sunni muslim druze and christian parties led by saad hariri son of assassinated ex prime minister rafik hariri won a majority of seats in the new parliament the combinations were interesting in that in some areas the anti syrian coalition allied with hezbollah and others with amal they did not win the two thirds majority required to force the resignation of syrian appointed president lahoud due to the unexpectedly strong showing of retired army general michel aoun s free patriotic movement party in mount lebanon aoun is the dominant christian figure in the new parliament known previously for

specific religious groups the president must be a maronite catholic christian the prime minister must be a sunni muslim and the speaker of the parliament must be a shi a muslim this arrangement is part of the national pact al mithaq al watani an unwritten agreement which was established in one nine four three during meetings between lebanon s first president a maronite and its first prime minister a sunni although it was not formalized in the constitution until one nine nine zero following the taif agreement the pact included a promise by the christians not to seek french protection and to accept lebanon s arab face and a muslim promise to recognize independence and legitimacy of the lebanese state in its one nine two zero boundaries and to renounce aspirations for union with syria this pact was thought at the time to be an interim compromise necessary until lebanon formed its own sense of a national identity its continued existence and the fallout from subsequent civil wars continue to dominate politics in lebanon the pact also stipulated that seats in the parliament would be allocated by religion and region in a ratio of six christians to five muslims a ratio based on the one nine three two census which was taken at a time when christians still had a slight majority the taif agreement adjusted the ratio to grant equal representation to followers of the two religions but some argue that they still do not reflect current demographics owing to a higher muslim birthrate and a higher rate of emigration among christians muslims are now believed to have a slight majority five nine percent of the population counting the druze however a majority of lebanese living abroad are christians the constitution grants the people the right to change their government however from the mid one nine seven zero s until the parliamentary elections in one nine nine two civil war precluded the exercise of political rights according to the constitution direct elections must be held for the parliament every four years the last parliament election was in two zero zero zero the election due to be held in two zero zero four was postponed for one year the parliament composition is based on more ethnic and religious identities rather than ideological features the distribution of parliament seats has been modified recently the parliament elects the president of the republic to a six year term consecutive terms for the president are forbidden this constitutional rule has been bypassed by ad hoc amendment twice in recent history however at the urging of the syrian government elias hrawi s term which was due to end in one nine nine five was extended for three years this procedure was repeated in two zero zero four to allow emile lahoud to remain in office until two zero zero seven pro democracy campaigners denounced the moves the last presidential election was in one nine nine eight the president appoints the prime minister on the nomination of the parliament lebanon has numerous political parties but their role is less important than in most parliamentary systems most represent in practice if not in theory sectarian interests many are little more than ad hoc lists of candidates endorsed by a well known national or local figure electoral tickets are often formed on a constituency by constituency basis by negotiation among local leaders of clans religious groups and political parties these loose coalitions generally exist only for the election and rarely form cohesive blocs in the parliament subsequently lebanon s judicial system is based on the napoleonic code juries are not used in trials the lebanese court system has three levels courts of first instance courts of appeal and the court of cassation there also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities with rules on matters such as marriage divorce and inheritance lebanese law does not provide for civil marriage although it recognizes such marriages contracted abroad efforts by former president elias hrawi to legalize civil marriage in the late one nine nine zero s foundered on objections mostly from muslim clerics lebanon has been under syrian domination since one nine nine zero more information is available here many lebanese are unhappy with what they see as the undue influence exerted by the syrian government over their affairs the pro syrian administration of emile lahoud has curbed freedom of speech and has attempted successfully until recently to ban demonstrations recently after the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri international pressure on syria was dramatically increased demanding a complete and immediate withdrawal of its forces including intelligence personnel from lebanon administrative division on monday february two eight two zero zero five the syrian backed government of prime minister omar karami announced its resignation staying on in a caretaker role however karami was reappointed and asked to head a national unity government on wednesday march nine two zero zero five one day after a massive demonstration expressing support for syria negotiations over the formation of the national unity government have stalled however over the demands of some politicians for the immediate withdrawal of syrian forces

wonders in addition there are virtually no records in the roman scripts that include even one reference to the ruins of baalbeck the jeita grotto the jeita grotto stalactites inside the cave the jeita

with urban centres and sophisticated arts present day lebanon was a centre for many nations and cultures its people roamed the mediterranean seas skilled in trade and in art they were also the creators of the oldest known two four letter alphabet a shortening of earlier three zero letter alphabets such as proto sinaitic and ugaritic phoenicia maintained an uneasy tributary relationship with the neo assyrian and neo babylonian empires it was conquered outright by the achaemenid dynasty of persia which organized it as a satrapy it was added to the empire of alexander the great who notably conquered tyre by extending a still extant causeway from the mainland in a seven month effort it fell to the seleucid empire after alexander s death the area was conquered by the roman empire in the first century bc and remained roman until the advent of the caliphate christianity was introduced to phoenicia from neighboring galilee soon after the time of jesus of nazareth the arab advances brought islam soon after the death of islam s prophet muhammad muslim influence increased greatly in the seventh century when the umayyad capital was established at nearby damascus during the middle ages lebanon was heavily involved in the crusades lebanon was in the main path of the first crusade s advance on jerusalem later frankish nobles occupied present day lebanon as part of the crusader states the southern half of present day lebanon formed the northern march of the kingdom of jerusalem the northern half was the heartland of the county of tripoli although saladin eliminated christian control of the holy land around one one nine zero the crusader states in lebanon and syria were better defended muslim control of lebanon was reestablished in the late one three th century under the mamluk sultans of egypt lebanon was later contested between muslim rulers until the ottoman empire solidified authority over the eastern mediterranean ottoman control was uncontested during the early modern period but the lebanese coast became important for its contacts and trades with venice and other italian city states the mountainous territory of mount lebanon has long been a shelter for minority and persecuted groups including the maronite christians and the druze heterodox muslims with shi a roots one nine th century during the nineteenth century the town of beirut became the most important port of the region supplanting acre further to the south this was mostly because mount lebanon became a centre of silk production for export to europe this industry made the region wealthy but also dependent on links to europe since most of the silk went to marseille the french began to have a great impact in the region the rise and fall of emir bashir ii in one seven eight eight bashir ii sometimes spelled bachir in french sources would rise to become the emir born into poverty he was elected emir upon the abdication of his predecessor and would rule under ottoman suzerainty being appointed wali or governor of mt lebanon the biqa valley and jabal amil together this is about two thirds of modern day lebanon he would reform taxes and attempt to break the feudal system in order to undercut rivals the most important of which was also named bashir bashir jumblatt whose wealth and feudal backers equaled or exceeded bashir ii and who had increasing support in the druze community in one eight two two the ottoman wali of damascus went to war with acre which was allied with muhammad ali the pasha of egypt as part of this conflict one of the most remembered massacres of maronite christians by druze forces occurred forces that were aligned with the wali of damascus jumblatt represented the increasingly disaffected druze who were both shut out from official power and angered at the growing ties with the maronites by bashir ii who was himself a maronite christian bashir ii was overthrown as wali when he backed acre and fled to egypt later to return and organize an army jumblatt gathered the druze factions together and the war became sectarian in character the maronites backing bashir ii the druze backing bashir jumblatt jumblatt declared a rebellion and between one eight two one and one eight two five there were massacres and battles with the maronites attempting to gain control of the mt lebanon district and the druze gaining control over the biqa valley in one eight two five bashir ii defeated his rival and killed him after the battle of al simqaniya bashir ii was not a forgiving man and repressed the druze particularly in and around beirut bashir ii who had come to power through local politics and nearly fallen from power because of his increasing detachment from them reached out for allies allies who looked on the entire area as the orient and who could provide trade weapons and money without requiring fealty and without it seemed being drawn into endless internal squabbles he disarmed the druze and allied with france governing in the name of the egyptian pasha muhammad ali who entered lebanon and formally took overlordship in one eight three two for the remaining eight years the sectarian and feudal rifts of the one eight two one one eight two five conflict were heightened by the increasing economic isolation of the druze and the increasing wealth of the maronites sectarian conflict european powers begin to intervene the discontent grew to open rebellion fed by both ottoman and british money and support bashir ii fled the ottoman empire reasserted control and mehmed h srev pasha whose sole term as grand vizier ran from one eight three nine to one eight four one appointed another member of the shihab family who styled himself bashir iii bashir iii coming on the heels of a man who by guile force and diplomacy had dominated mt lebanon and the biqa for five two years did not last long in one eight four one conflicts between the impoverished druze and the maronite christians exploded there was a massacre of christians by the druze at deir al qamar and the fleeing survivors were slaughtered by ottoman regulars the ottomans attempted to create peace by dividing mt lebanon into a christian district and a druze district but this would merely create geographic powerbases for the warring parties and it plunged the region back into civil conflict which included not only the sectarian warfare but a maronite revolt against the feudal class which ended in one eight five eight with the overthrow of the old feudal system of taxes and levies the situation was unstable the maronites lived in the large towns but these were often surrounded by druze villages living as perioikoi in one eight six zero this would boil back into full scale sectarian war when the maronites began openly opposing the power of the ottoman empire the druze took advantage of this and began burning maronite villages the long siege of deir al qamar found a maronite garrison holding out against druze forces backed by ottoman soldiers the area in every direction was despoiled by the besiegers in july of one eight six zero with european intervention threatening the turkish government tried to quiet the strife but napoleon iii of france sent seven zero zero zero troops to beirut and helped impose a partition the druze control of the territory was recognized as the fact on the ground and the maronites were forced into an enclave arrangements ratified by the concert of europe in one eight six one they were confined to a mountainous district cut off from both the biqa and beirut and faced with the prospect of ever growing poverty resentments and fears would brood ones which would resurface in the coming decades another destabilizing factor was france s support for the maronite christians against the druze which in turn led the british to back the druze exacerbating religious and economic tensions between the two communities in one eight five nine six zero violence erupted between the maronites and the druze the druze had grown increasingly resentful of the favoring of the maronites by bashir ii and were backed by the ottoman empire and the wali of damascus in an attempt to gain greater control over lebanon the maronites were backed by the french out of both economic and political expediency the druze began a military campaign that included the burning of villages and massacres while maronite irregulars retaliated with attacks of their own however the maronites were gradually pushed into a few strongholds and were on the verge of military defeat when the congress of europe intervened and established a commission to determine the outcome the french forces deployed there were then used to enforce the final decision the french accepted the druze as having established control and the maronites were reduced to a semi autonomous region around mt lebanon without even direct control over beirut itself the province of lebanon that would be controlled by the maronites but the entire area was placed under direct rule of the governor of damascus and carefully watched by the ottoman empire rising prosperity and peace the remainder of the one nine th century saw a relative period of stability as islamic druze and maronite groups focused on economic and cultural development which saw the founding of the american university of beirut and a flowering of literary and political activity associated with the attempts to liberalize the ottoman empire late in the century there was a short druze uprising over the extremely harsh government and high taxation rates but there was far less of the violence that had scalded the area earlier in the century in the approach to world war i beirut became a center of various reforming movements and would send delegates to the arab syrian conference and franco syrian conference held in paris there was a complex array of solutions from pan arab nationalism to separatism for beirut and several status quo movements that sought stability and reform within the context of ottoman government the young turk revolution brought these movements to the front hoping that the reform of ottoman empire would lead to broader reforms the outbreak of hostilities changed this as lebanon was to feel the weight of the conflict in the middle east more heavily than most other areas league of nations mandate following the collapse of the ottoman empire after world war i the league of nations mandated the five provinces that make up present day lebanon to the direct control of france initially the division of the arab speaking areas of the ottoman empire were to be divided by the sykes picot agreement however the final disposition was at the san remo conference of one nine two zero whose determinations on the mandates their boundaries purposes and organization was ratified by the league in one nine two one and put into effect in one nine two two according to the agreements reached at san remo france also had its control over what was termed syria recognised the french having taken damascus in one nine two zero however syria was scheduled to be an independent country a so called class a mandate and the rights granted to france were far less than over other mandate territories a class b mandate granted the right to administer the territories the entire mandate area was termed syria at the time including the administrative districts along the mediterranean coast wanting to maximize the area under its direct control contain an arab syria centered on damascus and insure a defensible border france established the lebanon syrian border to the anti lebanon mountains on the far side of the biqa valley territory which had belonged to the province of damascus for hundreds of years and was far more attached to damascus than beirut by culture and influence this doubled the territory under the control of beirut at the expense of what would become the state of syria consequently the demographics of lebanon were profoundly altered as the territory added contained people who were predominantly muslim or druze lebanese christians of which the maronites were the largest subgrouping now constituted barely more than five zero of the population while sunni muslims in lebanon saw their numbers increase eightfold shi ite muslims fourfold modern lebanon s constitution drawn up in one nine two six specified a balance of power between the various religious groups but france designed it to guarantee the political dominance of its christian allies the president was required to be a christian in practice a maronite the prime minister a sunni muslim on the basis of the one nine three two census parliament seats were divided according to a six to five christian muslim ratio the constitution gave the president veto power over any legislation approved by parliament virtually ensuring that the six five ratio would not be revised in the event that the population distribution changed by one nine six zero muslims were thought to constitute a majority of the population which contributed to muslim unrest regarding the political system independence peacefully lebanon gained independence in one nine four three and french troops withdrew in one nine four six lebanon s history from independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on beirut s position as a freely trading regional center for finance and trade beirut became a mecca for institutions of international commerce and finance as well as wealthy tourists and enjoyed a reputation as the paris of the middle east until the outbreak of the lebanese civil war regional conflict meanwhile in the aftermath of the one nine four eight arab israeli war lebanon became home to more than one one zero zero zero zero palestinian refugees displaced from their homeland more palestinians found their way to lebanon than to any other arab country more palestinian refugees arrived in lebanon after the one nine six seven arab israeli war following their defeat in the jordanian civil war thousands of palestinian militiamen regrouped in lebanon led by yasir arafat

sector driven prosperity other areas of the country however notably the south north and biqa valley experienced increasing impoverishment from one nine six eight palestinian militants of various affiliations began to use southern lebanon as a launching pad for attacks on israel two of these attacks led to a watershed event in lebanon s inchoate civil war in july one nine six eight a faction of george habash s popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp hijacked an israeli el al civilian plane en route to algiers in december habash himself oversaw an attack on an el al plane in athens resulting in two deaths later that month israeli agents flew into beirut s international airport and demolished one three civilian airliners belonging to various arab carriers israel defended its actions by informing the lebanese government that it was responsible for encouraging the pflp the retaliation which was intended to encourage a lebanese government crackdown on palestinian militants instead polarized lebanese society on the palestinian question deepening the divide between pro and anti palestinian factions with the maronites leading the former grouping and muslims primarily constituting the latter this dispute reflected increasing tensions between christian and muslim communities over the distribution of political power and would ultimately foment the outbreak of civil war in one nine seven five in the interim while armed lebanese forces under the maronite controlled government sparred with palestinian fighters egyptian leader gamal abd al nasser helped to negotiate the one nine six nine cairo agreement between arafat and the lebanese government which granted the plo autonomy over palestinian refugee camps and access routes to northern israel in return for plo recognition of lebanese sovereignty the agreement incited maronite frustration over what were perceived as excessive concessions to the palestinians and pro maronite paramilitary groups were subsequently formed to fill the vacuum left by government forces which were now required to leave the palestinians alone notably the phalange a maronite militia rose to prominence around this time led by members of the gemayel family charles d smith palestine and the arab israeli conflict pp three one zero three five three for its part the plo used its new privileges to establish an effective mini

elections in two zero years by early november one nine nine two a new parliament had been elected and prime minister rafiq hariri had formed a cabinet retaining for himself the finance portfolio the formation of a government headed by a successful billionaire businessman was widely seen as a sign that lebanon would make a priority of rebuilding the country and reviving the economy solidere a

political divisions that gave rise to and sustained that conflict remain largely unresolved parliamentary and more recently municipal elections have been held with fewer irregularities and more

during lebanon s civil war syria s troop deployment in lebanon was legitimized by the lebanese parliament in the taif agreement and supported by the arab league fifteen years later damascus justifies its continued military presence in lebanon by citing the continued weakness of the lebanese armed forces official requests by beirut and the agreement with the lebanese government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the taif agreement contrary to taif the hezbollah militia has not been dismantled and the laf has not been allowed to deploy along the border with israel though it was called on to do so by un security council resolution one three nine one urged by un resolution un security council resolution one four nine six and demanded by un security council resolution one five five nine the syrian military and intelligence presence in lebanon has been classified by some critics in lebanon and abroad as an occupation the united states and france in particular reject syrian reasoning that they are present by the consent of the lebanese government insisting that the latter has been co opted and cannot act independently an estimated two zero zero zero zero syrian troops down from three five zero zero zero remain in position in many areas of lebanon although taif stipulations called for agreement between the syrian and lebanese governments on their redeployment by september one nine nine two the syrian existence in lebanon maintains a modicum of stability but its refusal to exit the country following israel s two zero zero zero withdrawal from south lebanon has raised criticism from within lebanon initially among the lebanese maronite christians and druze but recently the sunni muslims as well syria has been accused of turning lebanon s government into a puppet recently the u s has begun applying pressure on syria to end its occupation and cease interfering with internal lebanese matters in two zero zero four syria has been pressuring lebanese mps to

position of the government of lebanon that the blue line is not valid in the shab a farms area is not compatible with security council resolutions the council has recognized the blue line as valid for purposes of confirming israel s withdrawal pursuant to resolution four two five one nine seven eight the government of lebanon should heed the council s repeated calls for the parties to respect the blue line in its entirety in resolution four two five the un had set a goal of assisting the lebanese government in a return of its effective authority in the area which would require an official lebanese army presence there further un security council resolution one five five nine requires the dismantling of the hezbollah militia yet hezbollah remains deployed along the blue line both hezbollah and israel have violated the blue line more than once according to the un the un secretary general has urged all governments that have influence on hezbollah to deter it from any further actions which could increase the tension in the area staffan de misura personal representative of the secretary general for southern lebanon stated that he was deeply concerned that air violations by israel across the blue line during altercations with hezbollah are continuing to take place calling upon the israeli authorities to cease such violations and to fully respect the blue line in two zero

which the un certified israel s withdrawal from south lebanon as complete on january two eight two zero zero five un security council resolution one five eight three called upon the government of lebanon to fully extend and exercise its sole and effective authority throughout the south including through the deployment of sufficient numbers of lebanese armed and security forces to ensure a calm environment throughout the area including along the blue line and to exert control over the use of force on its territory and from it on january two three two zero zero six the un security council

constitution on september three two zero zero four the national assembly voted nine six two nine to amend the constitution to allow the pro syrian president emile lahoud three more years in office by

in one nine nine eight immediately after he resigned as commander in chief of the laf three cabinet ministers were absent from the vote and later resigned the usa charged that syria exercised pressure against the national assembly to amend the constitution and many of the lebanese rejected it saying that it was considered as contradictive to the constitution and its principles including these is the maronite patriarch mar nasrallah boutros sfeir the most eminent religious figure for maronites and the druze leader walid jumblatt to the surprise of many prime minister rafiq hariri who had vehemently opposed this amendment appeared to have finally accepted it and so did most of his party however he ended up resigning in protest against the amendment he was assassinated soon afterwards

for the opposition un secretary general kofi annan expressed his serious concern over the attack on october seven two zero zero four un secretary general kofi annan reported to the security council that syria had failed to withdraw its forces from lebanon mr annan concluded his report saying that it is time one four years after the end of hostilities and four years after the israeli withdrawal from lebanon for all parties concerned to set aside the remaining vestiges of the past the withdrawal of foreign forces and the disbandment and disarmament of militias would with finality end that sad chapter of lebanese history on october one nine two zero zero four following the un secretary general s report the un security council voted unanimously meaning that it received the backing of algeria

sending a team led by ireland s deputy police commissioner peter fitzgerald to investigate the assassination and while arab league head amr moussa declared that syrian president assad promised him a phased withdrawal over a two year period the syrian information minister mahdi dakhlallah said mr moussa had misunderstood the syrian leader mr dakhlallah said that syria will merely move its troops to eastern lebanon local lebanese pressure mounted as well as daily protests against the syrian occupation grew to two five zero zero zero a series of dramatic events occurred massive protests such as these have been quite uncommon in the arab world and while in the nine zero s most anti syrian demonstrators were predominantly christian and put down by force the new demonstrations were distinctly non sectarian on february two eight the government of pro syrian prime minister omar karami resigned calling for a new election to take place mr karami said in his announcement i am keen the government will not be a hurdle in front of those who want the good for this country the tens of thousands gathered at beirut s martyrs square cheered the announcement then chanted karami has fallen your turn will come lahoud and yours bashar opposition mps were also not satisfied with karami s resignation and kept pressing for full syrian withdrawal former minister and mp marwan hamadeh who survived a similar car bomb attack on october one two zero zero four said i accuse this government of incitement negligence and shortcomings at the least and of covering up its planning at the most if not executing two days later syrian leader bashar assad announced that his troops will leave lebanon completely in the next few months responding to the announcement opposition leader walid jumblatt said that he wanted to hear more specifics from damascus about any withdrawal it s a nice gesture but next few months is quite vague we need a clear cut timetable on march three russia syria s cold war ally and germany had joined those calling for syria to comply with unscr one five five nine german chancellor gerhard schr der said lebanon should be given an opportunity for sovereignty and development and this can only be achieved by complying with security council resolutions that stipulate immediate syrian withdrawal from lebanon the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov stated that syria should withdraw from lebanon but we all have to make sure that this withdrawal does not violate the very fragile balance which we still have in lebanon which is a very difficult country ethnically arab states have also joined in with the withdrawal demands as al assad arrived in saudi arabia for emergency consultation with crown prince abdullah bin abdel aziz assad was told in no uncertain terms that syria must comply with un security council demands immediately it was reported that assad offered to remove most of the one five zero zero zero troops syria has stationed in

algeria should officially ask syria to withdraw giving the pullback an arab endorsement as envisaged in the one nine eight nine taif agreement rather than making it conditional on unscr one five five nine algerian foreign minister abdel aziz belkhadem discussed the consensus ahead of the summit stating that we all agreed to demand the implementation of the taif accord with respect to international legitimacy on march five syrian leader assad declared in a televised speech that syria would withdraw its forces to the bekaa valley in eastern lebanon and then to the border between syria and lebanon assad did not provide a timetable for a complete withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon one four zero zero zero soldiers and intelligence agents meanwhile hezbollah leader nasrallah called for a massive popular gathering on tuesday against un resolution one five five nine saying the resistance will not give up its arms because lebanon needs the resistance to defend it and added all the articles of un resolution give free services to the israeli enemy who should have been made accountable for his crimes and now finds that he is being rewarded for his crimes and achieves all its demands in opposition to nasrallah s call monday march seven th saw at least seven zero zero zero zero people with some estimates putting the number at twice as high gathered at central martyrs square

beirut most of them bussed in from the heavily shi ite south lebanon and eastern beka a valley the show of power demonstrated hezbollah s influence wealth and organization as the sole lebanese party allowed to hold a militia by syria in his speech nasrallah blasted un security council resolution one five five nine which calls for hezbollah s militia to be disbanded as foreign intervention nasrallah also reiterated his earlier calls for the destruction of israel saying to this enemy we say again there is no place for you here and there is no life for you among us death to israel though hezbollah organized a very successful rally opposition leaders were quick to point out that hezbollah had active support from lebanon s government and syria while the pro democracy rallies had to deal with road blocks forcing protestors to either turn back or march long distances to martyr s square hezbollah was able to bus people directly to riad solh square dory chamoun an opposition leader pointed out that the difference is that in our demonstrations people arrive voluntarily and on foot not in buses another opposition member said the pro syrian government pressured people to turn out and some reports said syria had bused in people from across the border but on a mountain road leading to beirut only one bus with a syrian license plate was spotted in a convoy of pro syrian supporters heading to the capital and hezbollah officials denied the charges opposition mp akram chehayeb said that is where the difference between us and them lies they asked these people to come and they brought them here whereas the opposition s supporters come here on their own our protests are spontaneous we have a cause what is theirs after weeks of international and local pressure it appeared that a un showdown was on its way a meeting between un special envoy terje roed larsen and syrian leader assad was scheduled for march one two roed larsen preceded the meeting by consulting with egypt jordan arab league chief amr mousa and lebanon roed larsen was expected to deliver an ultimatum to assad over compliance with unscr one five five nine this included compliance with honoring

expeditious providing a timeline for the withdrawal of some five zero zero zero syrian intelligence agents in lebanon finally disarming and dismantling foreign and domestic syrian supported militias in lebanon supporting roed larsen s mission russian foreign minister sergei lavrov speaking after talks with lebanese opposition leader walid jumblatt said russia was keeping a close eye on syrian troop movements and that syria s intelligence services should also pull out on the one month anniversary of hariri s murder an enormous anti syrian rally gathered at martyr s square in beirut multiple news agencies estimated the crowd at between eight zero zero zero zero zero and one million a show of force for the sunni christian and druze communities the rally was double the size of the mostly shi ite pro syrian one organized by hezbollah the previous week when hariri s sister took a pro syrian line saying that lebanon should stand by syria until its land is liberated and it regains its sovereignty on the israeli occupied golan heights the crowd jeered her this sentiment was prevalent among the rally participants who opposed hezbollah s refusal to disarm based on the claim that

lebanon stretches along the east side of the mediterranean sea with its length almost three times its width as it stretches from north to south the width of its terrain becomes narrower lebanon s mountainous terrain proximity to the sea and strategic location at a crossroads of the world were decisive factors in shaping its history the political economic and religious movements that either originated in the region or crossed through to leave an imprint upon lebanese society give form to that history the country s role in the region as indeed in the world at large was shaped by trade the area formerly part of the region known as greater syria served as a link between the mediterranean world and india and east asia the merchants of the region exported oil grain textiles metal work and pottery through the port cities to western markets the linkage role of lebanon was further enhanced by the nomads of the syrian and arabian deserts who visited the cities of syria to trade the caravans developed limited routes that often led to the coastal cities of tripoli beirut sidon or tyre this created a merchant class and brought wealth to the inhabitants of the region the trade between east and west led to the development of a cosmopolitan culture in lebanon s port cities whose inhabitants became known for their multilingualism flexibility moderation and commercial acumen lebanon was also affected by regional political conflicts and social movements the wealth of the region attracted powerful rulers who coveted its resources the strategic location was also attractive it was used either as a defensive position against enemies approaching the arab hinterland or as a stepping stone toward lebanon s neighbors over the centuries members of the nomadic tribes of the arabian peninsula sought a more prosperous life in lebanon to this day many lebanese families take pride in tracing their descent to ancient tribes of arabia moreover refugees belonging to minority sects have settled in its virtually inaccessible mountain valleys hence the region became a melting pot of cultural and social interaction among diverse groups in a social culture where blood lineage assumed primacy as a source of identification and affiliation the contrast between the new arab immigrant tribes and the settled inhabitants of the land frequently produced conflicts geographic coordinates land detailed map of lebanon two zero zero two the area of lebanon is approximately one zero four five two square kilometers the country is roughly rectangular in shape becoming narrower toward the south and the farthest north its widest point is eight eight kilometers and its narrowest is three two kilometers the average width is about five six kilometers the physical geography of lebanon is influenced by natural systems that extend outside the country thus the biqa valley is part of the great rift system which stretches from southern turkey to mozambique in africa like any mountainous country lebanon s physical geography is complex land forms climate soils and vegetation differ markedly within short distances there are also sharp changes in other elements of the environment from good to poor soils as one moves through the lebanese mountains a major feature of lebanese topography is the alternation of lowland and highland that runs generally parallel with a north to south orientation there are four such longitudinal strips between the mediterranean sea and syria the coastal strip or the maritime plain western lebanon the central plateau and eastern lebanon see fig three physical features the extremely narrow coastal strip stretches along the shore of the eastern mediterranean hemmed in between sea and mountain the sahil as it is called in lebanon is widest in the north near tripoli where it is only six five kilometers wide a few kilometers south at juniyah the approximately one five kilometer wide plain is succeeded by foothills that rise steeply to seven five zero meters within six five kilometers from the sea for the most part the coast is abrupt and rocky the shoreline is regular with no deep estuary gulf or natural harbor the maritime plain is especially productive of fruits and vegetables the western range the second major region is the lebanon mountains sometimes called mount lebanon or lebanon proper before one nine two zero since roman days the term mount lebanon has encompassed this area antilibanos anti lebanon was used to designate the eastern range geologists believe that the twin mountains once formed one range the lebanon mountains are the highest most rugged and most imposing of the whole maritime range of mountains and plateaus that start with the amanus or nur mountains in northern syria and end with the towering massif of sinai the mountain structure forms the first barrier to communication between the mediterranean and lebanon s eastern hinterland the mountain range is a clearly defined unit having natural boundaries on all four sides on the north it is separated from the nusayriyah mountains of syria by an nahr al kabir the great river on the south it is bounded by al qasimiyah river giving it a length of one six nine kilometers its width varies from about five six five kilometers near tripoli to nine five kilometers on the southern end it rises to alpine heights southeast of tripoli where al qurnat as sawda the black nook reaches three three six zero meters of the other peaks that rise east of beirut jabal sannin two six nine five meters is the highest ahl al jabal people of the mountain or simply jabaliyyun has referred traditionally to the inhabitants of western lebanon near its southern end the lebanon mountains branch off to the west to form the shuf mountains the third geographical region is the biqa valley this central highland between the lebanon mountains and the anti lebanon mountains is about one seven seven kilometers in length and nine six to one six kilometers wide and has an average elevation of seven six two meters its middle section spreads out more than its two extremities geologically the biqa is the medial part of a depression that extends north to the western bend of the orontes river in syria and south to jordan through al arabah to al aqabah the eastern arm of the red sea the biqa is the country s chief agricultural area and served as a granary of roman syria biqa is the arabic plural of buqaah meaning a place with stagnant water emerging from a base south of homs in syria the eastern mountain range or anti lebanon lubnan ash sharqi is almost equal in length and height to the lebanon mountains this fourth geographical region falls swiftly from mount hermon to the hawran plateau whence it continues through jordan south to the dead sea the barada gorge divides anti lebanon in the northern section few villages are on the western slopes but in the southern section featuring mount hermon two eight six meters the western slopes have many villages anti lebanon is more arid especially in its northern parts than mount lebanon and is consequently less productive and more thinly populated terrain bathymetric map of lebanon divided into five ribbon like topographical areas stretching from north to south the shoreline at two one zero km long it is mostly consisted of rocks towards north and sand south adding some headlands bays and offshore islands the coastal plain surrounded by sea and mountains it is rather narrow at two or three km wide mount lebanon the west mountains beqaa valley anti lebanon the east mountains climate lebanon has a mediterranean climate characterized by a long hot and dry summer and cool rainy winter fall is a transitional season with a gradual lowering of temperature and little rain spring occurs when the winter rains cause the vegetation to revive topographical variation creates local modifications of the basic climatic pattern along the coast summers are hot and humid with little or no rain heavy dews form which are beneficial to agriculture the daily range of temperature is not wide although temperatures may reach above three eight c in the daytime and below one six c at night a west wind provides relief during the afternoon and evening at night the wind direction is reversed blowing from the land out to sea winter is the rainy season with major precipitation falling after december rainfall is generous but is concentrated during only a few days of the rainy season falling in heavy cloudbursts the amount of rainfall varies greatly from one year to another occasionally there are frosts during the winter and about once every fifteen years a light powdering of snow falls as far south as beirut a hot wind blowing from the egyptian desert called the khamsin arabic for fifty may provide a warming trend during the fall but more often occurs during the spring bitterly cold winds may come from europe along the coast the proximity to the sea provides a moderating influence on the climate making the range of temperatures narrower than it is inland but the temperatures are cooler in the northern parts of the coast where there is also more rain in the lebanon mountains the gradual increase in altitude produces colder winters with more precipitation and snow the summers have a wider daily range of temperatures and less humidity in the winter frosts are frequent and snows heavy in fact snow covers the highest peaks for much of the year in the summer temperatures may rise as high during the daytime as they do along the coast but they fall far lower at night inhabitants of the coastal cities as well as visitors seek refuge from the oppressive humidity of the coast by spending much of the summer in the mountains where numerous summer resorts are located both the khamsin and the north winter wind are felt in the lebanon mountains the influence of the mediterranean sea is abated by the altitude and although the precipitation is even higher than it is along the coast the range of temperatures is wider and the winters are more severe the biqa valley and the anti lebanon mountains are shielded from the influence of the sea by the lebanon mountains the result is considerably less precipitation and humidity and a wider variation in daily and yearly temperatures the khamsin does not occur in the biqa valley but the north winter wind is so severe that the inhabitants say it can break nails despite the relatively low altitude of the biqa valley the highest point of which near baalbek is only one one zero zero meters more snow falls there than at comparable altitudes west of the lebanon mountains because of their altitudes the anti lebanon mountains receive more precipitation than the biqa valley despite their remoteness from maritime influences much of this precipitation appears as snow and the peaks of the anti lebanon like those of the lebanon mountains are snow covered for much of the year temperatures are cooler than in the biqa valley rivers and lakes although the country is well watered and there are many rivers and streams there are no navigable rivers nor is any one river the sole source of irrigation water drainage patterns are determined by geological features and climate although rainfall is seasonal most streams are perennial most rivers in lebanon have their origins in springs which are often quite large these springs emerge from the permeable limestone strata cropping out at the nine one five to one five two four meter level in the lebanon mountains in the anti lebanon mountains few springs emerge in this manner other springs emerge from alluvial soil and join to form rivers whatever their source the rivers are fast moving straight and generally cascade down narrow mountain canyons to the sea the biqa valley is watered by two rivers that rise in the watershed near baalbek the orontes flowing north in arabic it is called nahr al asi the rebel river because this direction is unusual and the litani flowing south into the hill region of the southern biqa valley where it makes an abrupt turn to the west and is thereafter called the al qasmiyah river the orontes continues to flow north into syria and eventually reaches the mediterranean in turkey its waters for much of its course flow through a channel considerably lower than the surface of the ground the nahr barada which waters damascus has as its source a spring in the anti lebanon mountains smaller springs and streams serve as tributaries to the principal rivers because the rivers and streams have such steep gradients and are so fast moving they are erosive instead of depository in nature this process is aided by the soft character of the limestone that composes much of the mountains the steep slopes of the mountains and the heavy rainstorms the only permanent lake is buhayrat al qirawn about ten kilometers east of jazzin there is one seasonal lake fed by springs on the eastern slopes of the lebanon

not crossing an international boundary rugged terrain historically helped isolate protect and develop numerous factional groups based on religion clan and ethnicity geography of lebanon geography by country the population of lebanon comprises many different ethnic groups and religions including numerous christian and muslim sects because the matter of religious balance is a sensitive political issue a national census has not been conducted since one nine three two before the founding of the modern lebanese state consequently there is an absence of accurate data on the relative percentages of the population of the major religions and groups source us state dept ethnic groups the lebanese though of lesser importance than religious belonging ethnic background is still a factor in lebanon the country encompasses a great mix of cultures and ethnic groups which have been building up for more than six zero zero zero years although most of the population is today considered arab in the sense that arabic is the national language the actual ethnic backgrounds vary the arabs only reached lebanon in the seven th century and their culture was superimposed on an already diverse ethnic population the intense mixing of populations has since then ensured that few really distinct ethnicities remain in lebanon and the question of ethnic identity has come to revolve more around cultural self identification than on provable genetic linkage generally it can be said that all religious sects comprise many different ethnic backgrounds and that clear ethnic boundaries are difficult to define still religious and ethnic distinctions sometimes coincide since religious sects have tended to marry within the group thus preserving not only religious but ethnic characteristics also one could claim that over time many of the religious sects have evolved into ethnic communities in their own right the druze are a prime example of this some lebanese especially among maronite christians see themselves as descendants of the phoenicians canaanites mardaites and tend to de emphasize or deny lebanon s arab heritage this identification with pre arab civilizations also exists in other religious communities albeit not to the same extent sunni and alawite muslim as well as greek orthodox and rural roman catholic christians are believed to be of a mixed levantine syrian shami origin lebanese armenians assyrians jews kurds and persians form more distinct ethnic minorities all of them in possession of a national home area outside of lebanon however they total less than four of the population palestinian refugees four zero two five eight two palestinian refugees were registered in lebanon with the united nations relief and works agency unrwa in march two zero zero five almost all refugees or descendants of refugees from the one nine four eight arab israeli war some of these may have emigrated during the civil war but there are no reliable figures available there are also a number of palestinians who are not registered as unrwa refugees because they left earlier than one nine four eight or were not in need of material assistance the exact number of palestinians remain a subject of great dispute and the lebanese government will not provide an estimate a figure of four zero zero zero zero zero palestinian refugees would mean that palestinians constitute more than one zero of the resident population of lebanon their presence is controversial and resisted by large segments of the christian population who argue that the primarily sunni muslim palestinians dilute christian numbers many shi a muslims also look unfavorably upon the palestinian presence since the camps have tended to be concentrated in their home areas as a result of this palestinians are not accorded the legal rights enjoyed by the rest of the population they are denied citizenship and confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps in which construction rights are severely constricted until recently it was unlawful for stateless palestinians to work in a large number of professions such as lawyers doctors etc but these proscriptions were repealed in two zero zero five after negotiations between lebanese authorities and ministers from the palestinian national authority the material situation of the palestinian refugees in lebanon is difficult and they are believed to constitute the poorest community in lebanon as well as the poorest palestinian community with the possible exception of gaza refugees their primary sources of income are unrwa aid and menial labor sought in competition with syrian guest workers the palestinians are mostly sunni muslim but there is also a christian minority of over one zero primarily greek orthodox the numbers of palestinian christians has diminished in later years as many have managed to leave lebanon during the lebanese civil war palestinian christians sided with the rest of the palestinian community instead of allying with lebanese greek orthodox or other christian sects see also demographics of palestine syrian workers and the one nine nine four naturalization lebanon holds a large number of syrian workers most of whom are employed on a season basis and do not hold citizenship they entered lebanon mainly after syria established its controversial military and political presence there during the lebanese civil war they are employed in menial labor working in areas such as construction they are generally very poor and compete with the palestinians over low wage jobs some right wing lebanese argue that the presence of such a large number of syrian workers should in fact be considered part of a syrian colonization attempt interlocking the economies and making lebanon excessively dependent on syria others have argued that the syrian laborers have been essential to post war reconstruction their exact numbers are disputed with right wing lebanese nationalists tending to give high estimates up to one five million while others go as low as three zero zero zero zero zero the cia factbook suggest a figure of one million two zero zero one regardless of which estimate is closer to the truth numbers would naturally fluctuate according to season and to the situation of the lebanese and syrian economies in one nine nine four lebanese authorities then under syrian domination authorized a controversial granting of citizenship to syrians and a small number of palestinians and others in lebanon the precise number is disputed figures ranging from a one zero zero zero zero zero people to half a million it seems clear however that the act shifted the religious balance in lebanon in favor of sunni muslims and had important effects on the sectarian makeup of lebanese politics the syrians in lebanon are arab in the same linguistic sense as the lebanese but with a less ambiguous arab self identification they are mainly muslims of the sunni sect but due to syria s diverse religious and ethnic population many other groups are also included see also demographics of syria other immigrants there are substantial numbers of immigrants from other arab countries notably egypt also recent years have seen an influx of people from south east asian countries such as indonesia the philippines and malaysia as well as smaller numbers of other immigrant minorites most of these are employed as guest workers in the same fashion as syrians and palestinians and entered the country to search for employment in the post war reconstruction of lebanon apart from the palestinians there are approximately one eight zero zero zero zero stateless persons in lebanon many of these are kurds from turkey and syria or other syrians religious groups the sectarian system lebanon s religious divisions are extremely complicated and the country is made up by a multitude of religious groupings the ecclesiastical and demographic patterns of the sects are complex divisions and rivalries between groups date back as far as one five centuries and still are a factor today the pattern of settlement has changed little since the seven th century but instances of civil strife and ethnic cleansing most recently during the lebanese civil war has brought some important changes to the religious map of the country see also history of lebanon lebanon has the by far largest proportion of christians of any arab country but both christians and muslims are sub divided into many splinter sects all population statistics are by necessity controversial and all sects have a vested interest in inflating their own numbers it is not uncommon to hear both sunnis shi as and maronites the three largest sects claim that their particular religious affiliation holds a majority in the country adding up to over one five zero of the total population even before counting the other sects one of the rare things that most lebanese religious leaders will agree on is to avoid a new general census out of fear that it could trigger a new round of sectarian conflict the last official census was performed in one nine three two religion has traditionally been of overriding importance in defining the lebanese population dividing state power between the religious sects and granting religious authorities judicial power dates back to ottoman times the millet system the practice was reinforced during french colonialism when christian groups were granted privileges this system of government while partly intended as a compromise between sectarian demands has caused tensions that still dominate lebanese politics to this day the christian population majority is believed to have ended in the early one nine three zero s but government leaders would agree to no change in the political power balance this led to muslim demands of increased representation and the constant sectarian tension slid into violent conflict in one nine five eight prompting u s intervention and again in the grueling lebanese civil war in one nine seven five nine zero the balance of power has been slightly adjusted in the one nine four three national pact an informal agreement struck at independence in which positions of power were divided according to the one nine three two census the sunni elite was then accorded more power but maronites continued to dominate the system the sectarian balance was again adjusted towards the muslim side but simultaneously further reinforced and legitimized shi a muslims by now the largest sect then gained additional representation in the state apparatus and the obligatory christian muslim representation in parliament was downgraded from a six five to a one one proportion christians of various sects were then generally thought to constitute about four zero of the population although often muslim leaders would cite lower numbers and some christians would claim that they still held a majority of the population the one eight recognized sects the present lebanese constitution officially acknowledges one eight religious groups see below these have the right to handle family law according to their own courts and traditions and they are the basic players in lebanon s complex sectarian politics still it is important to note that these groups are not internally homogeneous and for example the maronite shi a and druze communities have been wracked by internal fighting even in modern time maronite maronite catholic greek orthodox greek catholic armenian orthodox gregorian armenian catholic syrian orthodox jacobite syrian catholic roman catholic latins copts evangelical christian incl protestant groups such as baptists and seventh day adventists chaldean catholic nestorian assyrian twelver shi a sunni isma ili sevener shi a druze alawite jewish very few jews remain in lebanon today religious population statistics note stateless palestinians and syrians are not included in the below statistics since they do not hold lebanese citizenship the numbers only includes the present population of lebanon and not the lebanese diaspora the one nine three two census stated that christians made up five two of the population maronites largest among the christian sects and then largely in control of the state appartus accounted for two nine of the total population but since the one eight zero zero s muslim birth rates have been continually higher than christian birth rates with the fastest population increase among the twelver shi a also far larger numbers of christians emigrated from lebanon than muslims today there is general consensus that muslims constitute a clear majority of the population probably close to seven zero still there is no single sect constituting a majority of the population by itself the shi a is the largest community thought in one nine nine zero to be about three five of the population since then their numbers have increased even more while other communities have decreased due to emigration and some sources indicate they may be close to five zero of the population there is no consensus on this number and the shi a proportion of lebanon s population is among the most widely disputed figures of lebanese demographics the shi a has as the traditionally poorest community had a high birth rate and they have had no natural emigration outlet while most christians had extensive contacts with europe the united states and latin america and the sunnis could easily relocate to any neighbouring arab country since they constitute a majority in most of the arab world christians the maronites are the largest of the christian groups they have had a long and continuous association with the roman catholic church but have their own patriarch liturgy and customs traditionally they had good relations with the western world especially france and of course the vatican they traditionally dominated the lebanese government and the president of lebanon is always maronite their influence in later years have diminished due to their relative decrease in numbers but also due to the syrian presence in lebanon which generally benefited shi a and other muslim communities and was resisted by most maronites today the maronites are believed to compose nearly two zero of the population scattered around the lebanese countryside but with heavy concentrations on mount lebanon and in beirut the second largest christian group is the greek orthodox church the church exists in many parts of the arab world and greek orthodox christians have often been noted for pan arab leanings it has had less dealings with western countries than the maronites they constitute about five of the total population not counting the palestinian greek orthodox community the remaining christian churches are all very small with no single group over five of the total population please refer to their articles in the list above for more information for more information on lebanese christian sects see this page muslims shi a muslims of the twelver sect are the single largest religious group in lebanon today they are generally believed to be over four zero of the total population although estimates vary wildly they have traditionally been the poorest community in lebanon excepting the palestinians and this has brought high birth rates but low levels of political organization in the late one nine seven zero s a gradual political awakening had been under way for some time but the process was jolted forward by the shocks of israeli incursion in one nine seven nine and the rise of the islamic republic of iran the same year israeli occupation of southern lebanon from one nine eight two two zero zero zero led to an exodus of shi a towards the north and the rise of powerful islamist militias such as amal and hizbullah the presence of these militias forced the shi a community into central lebanese decision making and their position strengthened during the latter half of the lebanese civil war as well as during the syrian post war presence one nine nine zero two zero zero five the shi a are traditionally concentrated in the rural south of the country but large numbers now also live south of beirut in what has been dubbed the belt of misery slum neighbourhoods essentially controlled by hizbullah and amal and populated by refugees from the south the speaker of the lebanese parliament is always a member of the shi a sect sunni muslims is the second largest muslim group sunni notables traditionally held power in the lebanese state together with but overshadowed by maronite christians and they are still the only sect eligible for the post of prime minister sunni muslims are a majority everywhere else in the arab world except bahrain and iraq and so the sunni community has had close ties to these countries and ideologically tilted towards pan arabism today in lebanon they constitute circa two five of the total populations their numbers are further bolstered by the presence of the largely sunni palestinians and lacking a powerful militia of their own they became the prime allies of the palestinian liberation organization plo during the events leading up to and during the civil war the druze are a small tightly knit splinter sect of shi a islam many muslims regard them suspiciously arguing that they are not in fact muslims but rather a religion in their own right or in extreme cases labeling them heretics the druze also traditionally fought with christian maronites over control of their home areas in the chouf mountain the situation of the druze community in lebanon has been complicated since they have no natural allies and though originally a powerful sect their numbers have today declined to just over five of the population a succession of druze leaders most famously of the jumblatt family have attempted to outweigh this deficiency in numbers by a quick footed diplomacy and alliances with stronger communities during the civil war druze leaders allied at one point or another with nearly every other party to the conflict while there are also druze communities in syria and israel and among the populations expelled from the israeli occupied golan heights hard political boundaries prevent extensive interaction between them for information on the remaining muslim communities see the isma ili and alawite articles both groups constitute less than one of lebanon s population for more information on lebanese muslim sects see this page other religions there remains a very small jewish population traditionally centered in beirut it has been larger most jews left the country after the founding of israel in one nine four eight add to this some negligible numbers of native bah s buddhists and hindus of long since naturalized immigrant families new immigrants from south east asia have recently brought in larger numbers of buddhists and hindus and small populations of other immigrant religions are also present the lebanese diaspora apart from the three and a half million citizens of lebanon proper there is a sizeable lebanese diaspora no accurate numbers are available so estimates on the total size of the diaspora vary wildly from conservative estimates of four five million to a maximum and probably inflated figure of one five million most lebanese emigrants and their descendants are christian lebanese christian families are economically and politically prominent in several latin american countries and make up a substantial portion of the arab american community in the united states the largest lebanese diaspora is located in brazil where about seven million people have lebanese descent see arab brazilian the large size of lebanon s diaspora may be partly explained by the historical and cultural tradition of sea faring and travelling which stretches back to lebanon s ancient phoenician origins and its role as a gateway of relations between europe and the middle east it has been commonplace for lebanese citizens to emigrate in search of economic prosperity additionally several times in the last two centuries has the lebanese population endured periods of ethnic cleansing and displacement for example one eight four zero six zero and one nine seven five nine zero these factors have contributed to the geographical mobility of the lebanese people while under syrian influence beirut passed legislation which prevented second generation lebanese of the diaspora from automatically obtaining lebanese citizenship this has reinforced the emigr status of many diaspora lebanese there is currently a campaign by those lebanese of the diaspora who already have lebanese citizenship to attain the vote from abroad if suffrage was to be extended to these one two million lebanese emigr citizens it would have a significant political effect since as many as eight zero of the them are believed to be christians civil war refugees and displaced persons with no official figures available it is estimated that six zero zero zero zero zero nine zero zero zero zero zero persons fled the country during the civil war one nine seven five nine zero although some have since returned this permanently disturbed lebanese population growth and has greatly complicated demographic statistics another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons this especially affected the southern shi a community as israeli invasion of southern lebanon in one nine seven eight one nine eight two and one nine nine six prompted waves of mass emigration in addition to the continual strain of occupation and fighting between israel and hizbullah mainly one nine eight two to two zero zero zero many shi a resettled in hastily constructed slum suburbs south of beirut the so called belt of misery after the

zero s until the parliamentary elections in one nine nine two civil war precluded the exercise of political rights according to the constitution direct elections must be held for the parliament every four years the last parliament election was in two zero zero zero the parliament in turn elects a president every six years to a single term the president is not eligible for re election the last presidential election was in one nine nine eight the president and parliament choose the prime minister political parties may be formed most are based on sectarian interests syria occupied the greater part of the country from the time of the civil war until two zero zero five political developments since one nine four three since the emergence of the post one nine four three state national policy has been determined largely by a relatively restricted group of traditional regional and sectarian leaders the one nine four three national pact an unwritten agreement that established the political foundations of modern lebanon allocated political power on an essentially confessional system based on the one nine three two census seats in parliament were divided on a six to five ratio of christians to muslims until one nine nine zero when the ratio changed to half and half positions in the government bureaucracy are allocated on a similar basis the pact also allocated public offices along religious lines with the top three positions in the ruling troika distributed as follows the president is required to be a maronite christian the prime minister a sunni muslim and the speaker of the parliament a shi a muslim efforts to alter or abolish the confessional system of allocating power have been at the center of lebanese politics for decades those religious groups most favored by the one nine four three formula sought to preserve it while those who saw themselves at a disadvantage sought either to revise it after updating key demographic data or to abolish it entirely nonetheless many of the provisions of the national pact were codified in the one nine eight nine ta if agreement perpetuating sectarianism as a key element of lebanese political life although moderated somewhat under ta if the constitution gives the president a strong and influential position the president has the authority to promulgate laws passed by the parliament to issue supplementary regulations to ensure the execution of laws and to negotiate and ratify treaties the parliament is elected by adult suffrage majority age for election is two one based on a system of proportional representation for the various confessional groups most deputies do not represent political parties as they are known in the west and rarely form western style groups in the assembly political blocs are usually based on confessional and local interests or on personal family allegiance rather than on political affinities the parliament traditionally has played a significant role in financial affairs since it has the responsibility for levying taxes and passing the budget it also exercises political control over the cabinet through formal questioning of ministers on policy issues and by requesting a confidence debate lebanon s judicial system is based on the napoleonic code juries are not used in trials the lebanese court system has three levels courts of first instance courts of appeal and the court of cassation there also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities e g rules on such matters as marriage divorce and inheritance lebanese political institutions often play a secondary role to highly confessionalized personality based politics powerful families also still play an independent role in mobilizing votes for both local and parliamentary elections nonetheless a lively panoply of domestic political parties some even predating independence exists the largest are all confessional based the kataeb party also known as the phalange party the national bloc national liberal party lebanese forces the free patriotic movement and the guardians of the cedars now outlawed are the parties with the largest popular following among christians amal and hizballah are the main rivals for the organized shi a vote and the psp progressive socialist party is the leading druze party while shi a and druze parties command fierce loyalty to their leaderships there is more factional infighting among many of the christian parties sunni parties have not been the standard vehicle for launching political candidates and tend to focus across lebanon s borders on issues that are important to the community at large lebanon s sunni parties include the independent nasserite movement lebanon inm the tawhid lebanon and ahbash in addition to domestic parties there are branches of pan arab secular parties ba ath parties socialist and communist parties that were active in the one nine six zero s and throughout the period of civil war there are differences both between and among muslim and christian parties regarding the role of religion in state affairs there is a very high degree of political activism among religious leaders across the sectarian spectrum the interplay for position and power among the religious political and party leaders and groups produces a political tapestry of extraordinary complexity in the past the system worked to produce a viable democracy events over the last decade and long term demographic trends however have upset the delicate muslim christian druze balance and resulted in greater segregation across the social spectrum whether in political parties places of residence schools media outlets even workplaces there is a lack of regular interaction across sectarian lines to facilitate the exchange of views and promote understanding all factions have called for a reform of the political system some christians favor political and administrative decentralization of the government with separate muslim and christian sectors operating within the framework of a confederation muslims for the most part prefer a unified central government with an enhanced share of power commensurate with their larger share of the population the reforms of the ta if agreement moved in this direction but have not been fully realized palestinian refugees predominantly sunni muslims whose numbers are estimated at between one six zero zero zero zero two two five zero zero zero are not active on the domestic political scene nonetheless they constitute an important minority whose naturalization settlement in lebanon is vigorously opposed by most lebanese who see them as a threat to lebanon s delicate confessional balance on september three two zero

supported by syria which maintained a large military presence in lebanon following the withdrawal of syrian troops in april two zero zero five lebanon held parliamentary elections in four rounds from two nine may to one nine june the elections the first for three three years without the presence of syrian military forces were won by the rafik hariri martyr list a coalition of several parties and

called the assembly of representatives majlis al nuwab in arabic since the elections of one nine nine two the first since the reforms of the taif agreement of one nine eight nine removed the built in majority previously enjoyed by christians and distributed the seats equally between christians and muslims the parliament has had one two eight seats the term was four years but has recently been extended to five seats in the parliament are confessionally distributed but elected by universal suffrage each religious community has an allotted number of seats in the parliament see the table below they do not represent only their co religionists however all candidates in a particular constituency regardless of religious affiliation must receive a plurality of the total vote which includes followers of all confessions the system was designed to minimize inter sectarian competition and maximize cross confessional cooperation candidates are opposed only by co religionists but must seek support from outside of their own faith in order to be elected in practice this system has led to charges of gerrymandering the opposition qornet shehwan gathering a group opposed to the present pro syrian regime has claimed that constituency boundaries have been drawn so as to allow many shi a muslims to be elected from shi a majority constituencies where the hizbullah party is strong while allocating many christian members to muslim majority constituencies forcing christian politicians to represent muslim interests similar charges but in reverse were made against the chamoun administration in the one nine five zero s the following table sets out the confessional allocation of seats in the parliament before and after the taif agreement political parties and elections lebanon has numerous political parties but they play a much less significant role in lebanese politics than they do in most parliamentary democracies many of the parties are simply lists of candidates endorsed by a prominent national or local figure loose coalitions usually organized locally are formed for electoral purposes by negotiation among clan leaders and candidates representing various religious communities such coalitions usually exist only for the election and rarely form a cohesive bloc in the parliament after the election no single party has ever won more than one two five percent of the seats in the parliament and no coalition of parties has won more than three five percent especially outside of the major cities elections tend to focus more on local than national issues and it is not unusual for a party to join an electoral ticket in one constituency while aligned with a rival party even an ideologically opposite party in another constituency the last elections took place between may three zero and june two zero two zero zero five judicial branch four courts of cassation three courts for civil and commercial cases and one court for criminal cases

international banks and insurance companies are returning the government nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena it has had to fund reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting borrowing reducing the government budget deficit is a major goal of the lahoud government the stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern lebanon could lead to wider hostilities that would disrupt vital capital inflows furthermore the gap between rich and poor has widened in the one nine nine zero s resulting in grassroots dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction s benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving living conditions further details lebanon has a competitive and

the long civil war one nine seven five eight nine and the israeli occupation of the south one nine seven eight two zero zero zero in addition the delicate social balance and the near dissolution of central government institutions during the civil war handicapped the state as it sought to capture revenues to fund the recovery effort thus it accumulated significant debt which by two zero zero one

reduced customs duties adopted export promotion schemes for agriculture decreased social security fees and restrictions on investment in real estate by foreigners and adopted an open skies policy with

one nine eight nine to four in two zero zero zero in two zero zero one the government turned its focus to fiscal measures increasing gasoline taxes reducing expenditures and approving a value added tax that became effective in february two zero zero two slow money growth and dollarization of deposits have hampered the ability of commercial banks to finance the government leaving more of the burden to the central bank this monetization of the fiscal deficit has put enormous pressure on central bank reserves mitigated only slightly with the issuance of new eurobonds over the past two years the central bank has maintained a stable currency by intervening directly in the market as well as low inflation and succeeded in maintaining investors confidence in debt it has done so at a cost however as international reserves declined by two four billion in two zero zero zero and by one six billion in the first half of two zero zero one for two zero zero two the government has put primary emphasis on privatization initially in the telecom sector and electricity with continued planning for sales of the state airline beirut port and water utilities the government has pledged to apply the proceeds of sales to reducing the public debt and the budget deficit in addition it projects that privatization will bring new savings as government payrolls are pared interest rates decline and private sector growth and foreign investment are stimulated the government also is tackling the daunting task of administrative reform aiming to bring in qualified technocrats to address ambitious economic programs and reviewing further savings that can be realized through reforms of the income tax system the lebanese government faces major challenges in order to meet the requirements of a

these ideals strongly coloured the attitudes of the settlers toward the indigenous african people the new nation as they perceived it was coextensive with the settler community and with those africans who were assimilated into it because of mutual mistrust and hostility between the americans along the coast and the natives of the interior a recurrent theme in the country s subsequent history therefore was the usually successful attempt of the americo liberian minority to dominate people whom they considered uncivilized and inferior they named the land liberia which in european languages and in latin in particular means land of the free stephen allen benson president of liberia one eight five six one eight six four the founding of liberia was privately sponsored by american religious and philanthropic groups but the colony enjoyed the support and unofficial cooperation of the united states government liberia s government modeled after that of the united states was democratic in structure if not always in substance after one eight seven seven the true whig party monopolized political power in the country and competition for office was usually contained within the party whose nomination virtually ensured election two problems confronting successive administrations were pressure from neighboring colonial powers britain and france and the threat of financial insolvency both of which challenged the country s sovereignty liberia retained its independence during the scramble for africa but lost its claim to extensive territories that were annexed by britain and france economic development was retarded by the decline of markets for liberian goods in the late nineteenth century and by indebtedness on a series of loans payments on which drained the economy william r tolbert jr left president of liberia one nine seven three significant mid two zero th century events two events were of particular importance in releasing liberia from its self imposed isolation the first was the grant in one nine two six of a large concession to the american owned firestone plantation company that move became a first step in the modernization of the liberian economy the second occurred during world war ii when the united states began providing technical and economic assistance that enabled liberia to make economic progress and introduce social change one nine eight zero coup under doe on one two april one nine eight zero a successful military coup was staged by a group of noncommissioned officers of tribal origins led by master sergeant samuel kanyon doe and they executed the president of nine years william r tolbert jr in his mansion constituting themselves the people s redemption council doe and his associates seized control of the government and brought an end to liberia s first republic president tolbert with american president carter in monrovia one nine seven eight doe made strong ties with the united states in the early one nine eight zero s receiving more than five zero zero million for pushing out the soviet union from the country and allowing exclusive rights for the us to use liberia s ports and land including allowing the cia to use

one nine nine seven taylor s brutal regime targeted several leading opposition and political activists in one nine nine eight the government sought to assassinate child rights activist kimmie weeks

nine more than two zero zero zero zero zero people are estimated to have been killed in the civil wars the conflict intensified in mid two zero zero three when the fighting moved closer to monrovia as the power of the government shrank and with increasing international and american pressure for him to resign president charles taylor accepted an asylum offer by nigeria but vowed god willing i will be back politics main article politics of liberia the americo liberians had little in common with the tribal communities living inland because development of the country tended to be in only the capital city where the americo liberians people lived the tribes felt left out and cheated of the country s wealth which they believed to be their own one of these tribes was the krahn to which samuel doe belonged that was partly the reason for the one nine eight zero coup in the run off election of november eight two zero zero five between soccer legend george weah and former finance minister

with deep verandahs and established thriving trade links with other west africans the americo liberians distinguished themselves from the local people characterized as natives by the universal appelation of mr the formation of the republic of liberia did not occur altogether without difficulty almost from the beginning the settlers periodically encountered stiff opposition from local tribesmen usually resulting in bloody battles on the other hand colonial expansionists encroached on the newly independent liberia and took over much of the original territory of independent liberia

of one seven six zero zero zero zero square kilometers and a mediterranean coastline of nearly one eight zero zero kilometers libya is fourth in size among the countries of africa and fifteenth among the countries of the world it lies between egypt and tunisia although the oil discoveries of the one nine six zero s have brought it immense petroleum wealth at the time of its independence it was an extremely poor desert state whose only important physical asset appeared to be its strategic location at the midpoint of africa s northern rim it lay within easy reach of the major european nations and linked the arab countries of north africa with those of the middle east facts that throughout history had made its urban centers bustling crossroads rather than isolated backwaters without external social influences consequently an immense social gap developed between the cities cosmopolitan and peopled largely by foreigners and the desert hinterland where tribal chieftains ruled in isolation and where social change was minimal geographical summary the mediterranean coast and the sahara desert are the country s most prominent natural features there are several highlands but no true mountain ranges except in the largely empty southern desert near the chadian border where the tibesti massif rises to over two two zero zero meters a relatively narrow coastal strip and highland steppes immediately south of it are the most productive agricultural regions still farther south a pastoral zone of sparse grassland gives way to the vast sahara desert a barren wasteland of rocky plateaus and sand it supports minimal human habitation and agriculture is possible only in a few scattered oases between the productive lowland agricultural zones lies the gulf of sidra where along the coast a stretch of five zero zero kilometers of wasteland desert extends northward to the sea this barren zone known as the sirtica has great historical significance to its west the area known as tripolitania has characteristics and a history similar to those of nearby tunisia algeria and morocco it is considered with these states to constitute a supranational region called the maghrib to the east the area known historically as cyrenaica has been closely associated with the arab states of the middle east in this sense the sirtica marks the dividing point between the maghrib and the mashriq along the shore of tripolitania for more than three zero zero kilometers coastal oases alternate with sandy areas and lagoons inland from these lies the jifarah plain a triangular area of some one five zero zero zero square kilometers about one two zero kilometers inland the plain terminates in an escarpment that rises to form the jabal mountain nafusah a plateau with elevations of up to one zero zero zero meters in cyrenaica there are fewer coastal oases and the marj plain the lowland area corresponding to the jifarah plain of tripolitania covers a much smaller area the lowlands form a crescent about two one zero kilometers long between benghazi and darnah and extend inland a maximum of five zero kilometers elsewhere along the cyrenaican coast the precipice of an arid plateau reaches to the sea behind the marj plain the terrain rises abruptly to form jabal al akhdar green mountain so called because of its leafy cover of pine juniper cypress and wild olive it is a limestone plateau with maximum altitudes of about nine zero zero meters from jabal al akhdar cyrenaica extends southward across a barren grazing belt that gives way to the sahara desert which extends still farther southwest across the chad frontier unlike cyrenaica tripolitania does not extend southward into the desert the southwestern desert known as fezzan was administered separately during both the italian regime and the federal period of the libyan monarchy in one nine six nine the revolutionary government officially changed the regional designation of tripolitania to western libya of cyrenaica to eastern libya and of fezzan to southern libya however the old names were intimately associated with the history of the area and during the one nine seven zero s they continued to be used frequently cyrenaica comprises five one fezzan three three and tripolitania one six of the country s area before libya achieved independence its name was seldom used other than as a somewhat imprecise geographical expression the people preferred to be referred to as natives of one of the three constituent regions the separateness of the regions is much more than simply geographical and political for they have evolved largely as different socioeconomic entities each with a culture social structure and values different from the others cyrenaica became arabized at a somewhat earlier date than tripolitania and beduin tribes dominated it the residual strain of the indigenous berber inhabitants however still remains in tripolitania fezzan has remained a kind of north african outback its oases peopled largely by minority ethnic groups the border between tripolitania and tunisia is subject to countless crossings by legal and illegal migrants no natural frontier marks the border and the ethnic composition language value systems and traditions of the two peoples are nearly identical the cyrenaica region is contiguous with egypt and here too the border is not naturally defined illegal as well as legal crossings are frequent in contrast fezzan s borders with algeria niger and chad are seldom crossed because of the almost total emptiness of the desert countryside other factors too such as the traditional forms of land tenure have varied in the different regions in the one nine eight zero s their degrees of separateness was still sufficiently pronounced to represent a significant obstacle to efforts toward achieving a fully unified libya geographic coordinates area and boundaries area total one seven five nine five four zero km land one seven five nine five four

closing line three two degrees three zero minutes north climate and hydrology dust storm over libya within libya as many as five different climatic zones have been recognized but the dominant climatic influences are mediterranean and saharan in most of the coastal lowland the climate is mediterranean with warm summers and mild winters rainfall is scanty and the dry climate results in a year round nine eight percent visibility the weather is cooler in the highlands and frosts occur at maximum elevations in the desert interior the climate has very hot summers and extreme diurnal temperature ranges less than two of the national territory receives enough rainfall for settled agriculture the heaviest precipitation occurring in the jabal al akhdar zone of cyrenaica where annual rainfall of four zero zero to six zero zero millimeters is recorded all other areas of the country receive less than four zero zero millimeters and in the sahara five zero millimeters or less occurs rainfall is often erratic and a pronounced drought may extend over two seasons for example epic floods in one nine four five left tripoli under water for several days but two years later an unprecedentedly severe drought caused the loss of thousands of head of cattle deficiency in rainfall is reflected in an absence of permanent rivers or streams and the approximately twenty perennial lakes are brackish or salty in one nine eight seven these circumstances severely limited the country s agricultural potential as a basis for the sound and varied economy qadhafi sought to establish the allocation of limited water is considered of sufficient importance to warrant the existence of the secretariat of dams and water resources and damaging a source of water can be penalized by a heavy fine or imprisonment the government has constructed a network of dams in wadis dry watercourses that become torrents after heavy rains these dams are used both as water reservoirs and for flood and erosion control the wadis are heavily settled because soil in their bottoms is often suitable for agriculture and the high water table in their vicinity makes them logical locations for digging wells in many wadis however the water table is declining at an alarming rate particularly in areas of intensive agriculture and near urban centers the government has expressed concern over this problem and because of it has diverted water development projects particularly around tripoli to localities where the demand on underground water resources is less intense it has also undertaken extensive reforestation projects there are also numerous springs those best suited for future development occurring along the scarp faces of the jabal nafusah and the jabal al akhdar the most talked about of the water resources however are the great subterranean aquifers of the desert the best known of these lies beneath al kufrah oasis in southeastern cyrenaica but an aquifer with even greater reputed capacity is located near the oasis community of sabha in the southwestern desert in the late one nine seven zero s wells were drilled at al kufrah and at sabha as part of a major agricultural development effort an even larger undertaking is the so called great man made river initiated in one nine eight four it is intended to tap the tremendous aquifers of the al kufrah sarir and sabha oases and to carry the

socialist and islamic theories and rejects parliamentary democracy and political parties in reality qadhafi exercises near total control over the government for the first seven years following the revolution colonel qadhafi and one two fellow army officers the revolutionary command council began a complete overhaul of libya s political system society and economy on three march one nine seven seven qadhafi convened a general people s congress gpc to proclaim the establishment of people s power change the country s name to the socialist people s libyan arab jamahiriya and to vest theoretically primary authority in the gpc qadhafi remained the de facto chief of state and secretary general of the gpc until one nine eight zero when he gave up his office he continues to control all aspects of the libyan government through direct appeals to the masses a pervasive security apparatus and powerful revolutionary committees although he holds no formal office qadhafi exercises absolute power with the assistance of a small group of trusted advisers who include relatives from his home base in the surt region which lies between the rival provinces of tripolitania and cyrenaica the libyan court system consists of four levels summary courts which try petty offenses the courts of first instance which try more serious crimes the courts of appeals and the supreme court which is the final appellate level the gpc appoints justices to the supreme court special revolutionary courts and military courts operate outside the court system to try political offenses and crimes against the state libya s justice system is nominally based on sharia law after the revolution qadhafi took increasing control of the government but he also attempted to achieve greater popular participation in local government in one nine seven three he announced the start of a cultural revolution in schools businesses industries and public institutions to oversee administration of those organizations in the public interest the march one nine seven seven establishment of people s power with mandatory popular participation in the selection of representatives to the gpc was the culmination of this process in the one nine eight zero s competition grew between the official libyan government and military hierarchies and the revolutionary committees an abortive coup attempt in may one nine eight four apparently mounted by libyan exiles with internal support led to a short lived reign of terror in which thousands were imprisoned and interrogated an unknown number were executed qadhafi used the revolutionary committees to search out alleged internal opponents following the coup attempt thereby accelerating the rise of more radical elements inside the libyan power hierarchy in one nine eight eight faced with rising public dissatisfaction with shortages in consumer goods and setbacks in libya s war with chad qadhafi began to curb the power of the revolutionary committees and to institute some domestic reforms the regime released many political prisoners and eased restrictions on foreign travel by libyans private businesses were again permitted to operate in the late one nine eight zero s qadhafi began to pursue an anti islamic fundamentalist policy domestically viewing fundamentalism as a potential rallying point for opponents of the regime ministerial positions and military commanders are frequently shuffled or placed under temporary house arrest to diffuse potential threats to qadhafi s authority despite these measures internal dissent continues qadhafi s security forces launched a preemptive strike at alleged coup plotters in the military and among the warfallah tribe in october one nine nine three widespread arrests and government reshufflings followed accompanied by public confessions from regime opponents and allegations of torture and executions the military once qadhafi s strongest supporters became a potential threat in the one nine nine zero s

highest per capita gdps in africa but little of this income flows down to the lower orders of society in this statist society import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs the nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors which account for about two zero of gdp have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to

particularly western influence in the middle east and africa and support for a range of revolutionary causes after the one nine six nine coup qadhafi closed american and british bases on libyan territory and partially nationalized all foreign oil and commercial interests in libya he also played a key role in promoting the use of oil embargoes as a political weapon for challenging the west hoping that an oil price rise and embargo in one nine seven three would persuade the west especially the united states to end support for israel qadhafi rejected both soviet communism and western capitalism and claimed he was charting a middle course libya s relationship with the former soviet union involved massive libyan arms purchases from the soviet bloc and the presence of thousands of east bloc advisers libya s use and heavy loss of soviet supplied weaponry in its war with chad was a notable breach of an apparent soviet libyan understanding not to use the weapons for activities inconsistent with soviet objectives as a result soviet libyan relations reached a nadir in mid one nine eight seven after the dissolution of the warsaw pact and the soviet union libya concentrated on expanding diplomatic ties with third world countries and increasing its commercial links with europe and east asia following the imposition of united nations sanctions in one nine nine two these ties significantly diminished following a one nine nine eight arab league meeting in which fellow arab states decided not to challenge un sanctions qadhafi announced that he was turning his back on pan arab ideas one of the fundamental tenets of his philosophy instead libya pursued closer bilateral ties particularly with north african nations egypt tunisia and morocco it also has sought to develop its relations with sub saharan africa leading to libyan involvement in several internal african disputes in the democratic republic of congo sudan somalia central african republic eritrea and ethiopia libya also has sought to expand its influence in africa through financial assistance ranging from aid donations to impoverished neighbors such as niger to oil subsidies to zimbabwe qadhafi has proposed a borderless united states of africa to transform the continent into a single nation state ruled by a single government this plan has been moderately well received although more powerful

rstentum liechtenstein is a tiny doubly landlocked country in western europe bordered by switzerland to its west and by austria to its east mountainous it is a winter sports resort though it is perhaps best known as a tax haven history main article history of liechtenstein the modern territory of liechtenstein formed at one time an albeit diminutive part of the ancient roman province of raetia for centuries this territory geographically removed from european strategic interests had little impact on the tide of european history prior to the reign of its current dynasty the region was enfiefed to a line of the counts of hohenems the liechtenstein dynasty from which the principality takes its name rather than vice versa comes from castle liechtenstein in faraway lower austria which the family possessed from at least one one four zero to the one three th century and from one eight zero seven onwards through the centuries the dynasty acquired vast swathes of land predominantly in moravia lower austria silesia and styria though in all cases these territories were held in fief under other more senior feudal lords particularly under various lines of the habsburg family which several liechtenstein princes served as close advisors thus and without any territory held directly under the imperial throne the liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the imperial diet the reichstag the family yearned for the added power which a seat in the imperial government would garner and therefore searched for lands to acquire which would be unmittelbar or held without any feudal personage other than the emperor himself having rights on the land after some time the family was able to arrange the purchase of the minuscule herrschaft lordship of schellenberg and countship of vaduz in one six nine nine and one seven one two respectively from the hohenems tiny schellenberg and vaduz possessed exactly the political status required no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain emperor thereby on january two three one seven one nine after purchase had been duly made emperor charles vi decreed vaduz and schellenberg were united and raised to the dignity of f rstentum principality with the name liechtenstein in honour of his true servant anton florian of liechtenstein it is on this date that liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the holy roman empire ironically but as testament to the pure political expediency of the purchases the princes of liechtenstein did not set foot in their new principality for several decades schloss vaduz overlooking the capital is still home to the princes of liechtenstein in one eight zero six most of the holy roman empire was invaded by napoleon bonaparte s france this event had broad consequences for liechtenstein imperial legal and political mechanisms broke down while the holy roman emperor abdicated the imperial throne the empire itself dissolved as a result liechtenstein ceased to have any obligations to any feudal lord beyond its borders modern publications generally although incorrectly attribute liechtenstein s sovereignty

expropriations subject to modern legal dispute at the world court included over one six zero zero km of agricultural and forest land including also several family castles and palaces it is thus little wonder that during the decades of the cold war citizens of liechtenstein were forbidden by czechoslovakia from even entering that country in financial straits following the war the liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures including for instance da vinci s priceless portrait ginevra de benci which was purchased by the united states government however the

controversy in recent years critics were however largely discredited when in march two zero zero three a popular referendum bolstered the liechtenstein dynasty s constitutional position prior to the referendum prince hans adam had announced that he and his family would relocate to vienna austria if the house s constitutional prerogatives were curbed the referendum confirmed the broad popularity of the liechtenstein dynasty and underscored the populace s faith in prince hans adam as leader administrative division the parliamentary elections of march one one and one three th two zero zero five
